MIMO development log

$ python ./manage.py startpap mimo

- Created the models in models.py
- Importing mimo/urls.py
- Added memo to INSTALLED_APPS
- Registered models with admin.py
- Added placeholder views in views.py
- Added placeholder URLs in urls.py

$ python ./manage.py makemigrations mimo
$ python ./manage.py migrate mimo
$ python /.manage.py runserver

Can now edit the admin elements and view the (dummy) views through URLS:
http://localhost:8000/mimo/plan/
http://localhost:8000/mimo/mi/
http://localhost:8000/mimo/live/
http://localhost:8000/mimo/mo/

Let’s have some operations for:
- viewing the defaults.
- viewing the contents of the current mode.
- Changing the mode.
- Changing the current crate.

Turns out I need blank=True to allow blank foreign keys - NULL is only used to determine how such non-references are represented in the database. So:

$ python ./manage.py makemigrations mimo
$ python ./manage.py migrate mimo

Add mimo/templates/mimo and some basic files, and populate the first view.
Change Settings to use a Manager to return settings().
