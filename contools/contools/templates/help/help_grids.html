<h2>Programme Grid pages</h2>
<p>
Clicking on one of the grid-times buttons on the main page will display
the programme grid for that given day and time-chunk.
</p>

<h3>Above the grid</h3>
<p>

At the very top of the page, there's the usual banner with shortcuts
to the Main page, Grids, People, Items, Rooms, etc.
</p>

<p>

Beneath the banner, it'll say the day and time
period "e.g. Friday 2pm-6pm", which also appears in the title of the browser's
window or tab.

</p>

Next, there are several arrow buttons. The left and right arrow buttons (when present)
move you through earlier and later in the day, respectively. The up and down arrow buttons
move you to the same time on the previous and later days, respectively. Be aware that the
grid's orientation for time can vary, so the arrow arrangement might not always make sense
to you.
</p>
<p>
These arrows also appear beneath the grid, too.
</p>
<h3>The grid</h3>
<p>
The grid shows a table of rooms vs time-slots. The orientation can vary.
</p>

<p>
By default, for Redemption, grid lists the Rooms down the Y axis, and time along the X axis,
in the manner of Redemption's Programme Booklet, while for Odyssey, the X and Y axes are flipped,
so that you have rooms along the top, and times down the side. This is Judith's preference.
</p>

<p>
Rooms are listed by their <em>grid order</em> (see <a href=help_rooms.html>Rooms</a>); this is more convenient than, say, alphabetical, because it means the most commonly-used rooms are the first you see.
</p>

<p>
Rooms should only be listed if they have "show in grid" set for
them. So, for example, Secure Store and Ops rooms shouldn't show
up here. However, at time of writing, I don't think I've implemented
that - I think it'll show all rooms.
</p>


<p>
Initially, the database will be devoid of programme items, and so
you won't see a very exciting grid: every slot will contain a "Fill
Slot" button, so it might be better to come back to this page after
you've entered a few programme items...
</p>

<p>

Each slot on the grid will show one of two things:

<ul>
<li> If there are programme items assigned to this room at this time,
they'll be listed. There may be multiple item using the room at any
one time (if you're partway through rearranging things), so all
will be shown.</li>

<li> Otherwise, you'll have a "Fill slot" button, which allows you to
assign already-existing items to this time slot.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>

Programme grids can display items in lots of modes, controlled by the switches
between the grid (and described further down this page), but generally you might see:

<ul>
<li> The item's title (the bit in bold).</li>
<li> The names of anyone associated with the item. "(no-one)", if there isn't any.</li>
<li> Any tags associated with the item.</li>
</ul>

On the Redemption database, you'll also see items' shortnames. You can ignore
them on the Odyssey database, because they're all auto-generated and don't contain
useful information.
</p>

<p>
In each case, all the things displayed in a given room/time square are links:
<ul>
<li> Clicking on the item's title (or shortname) takes you to the item's page.</li>
<li> Clicking on a person's name takes you to the person's page.</li>
<li> Clicking on the item's tags (name or image) takes you to the tags's page.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Note that if an item name or a person name is <em>in italics</em>, then it indicates
that that item/person is marked as "don't show in programme booklet".
</p>
<h3>Fill Slot</h3>
<p>
When you click on "Fill Slot", you're presented with a new page,
entitled "Move what to this slot?". The page has a drop-down list
to allow you to select the programme item you want to move . The
list shows all the items, sorted by title (or shortname, for Redemption),
but it lists items without real rooms (i.e. those in <em>Nowhere</em>, or
that really don't have a room) first, and <em>then</em> it lists the rooms
which already have a real room. You can tell the difference because the
items with real rooms are prefixed with "-".
</p>

<p>
When you've found the item you want to position there,
you click the "Move" button, and the programme item will be moved.
</p>

<p>

Somewhat annoying, you're then presented with a page that says the
items been moved, and which presents you with the option to view
the item (the link) or go back to the grid you were on (the "Back
to grid" button). You probably just want to be taken back to the
grid you were on, without being asked.
</p>

<p>

At time of writing, there isn't a way of saying, "create new item
here", which both Steve R and Judith have asked for. With the
exception of the Opening and Closing ceremonies, I think it's
unlikely you're going to know, on first entry, which room and what
time a programme item will have, which is why the database currently
works the way it does, but this can be changed.
</p>

<h3>Grid options</h3>
<p>
At the bottom of the page, there are a load of choices for controlling
how the grid is displayed. Choose how you'd like to see things, then
click Redraw.

<ul>
<li> Shortnames vs titles
<ul>
<li> <em>Show Shortnames</em> - Display shortnames, but not titles. Only useful on Redemption.</li>

<li> <em>Shortname:Title</em> - Display both, colon-separated. only useful on Redemption.</li>
<li> <em>Neither</em> - Display neither title nor shortname.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Orientation
