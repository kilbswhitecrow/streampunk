<h2>People</h2>
<p>
People are everybody who appears on the programme in some form. They have
the following attributes:
<ul>
<li>Name - their real name.</li>
<li>Badge - their badge name. This is optional, but if specified, this is
what'll be used in Programme Grid listings, instead of Real Name.</li>
<li>Memnum - membership number. As assigned by the membership database, or
-1 if not known. This isn't updated automatically, btw, so if you create
a record for someone who has joined the con, look them up in the membership
database first. If they haven't joined yet, put -1 in. Later, you'll have to
go back and update it with their actual membership number, after they've joined.</li>
<li>Email - their email address. This just should <em>just</em> the email
address, so:
<ul>
<li> fred@site.com is okay</li>
<li> Fred Smith &lt;fred@site.com&gt; is wrong</li>
<li> fred@site.com (Fred Smith) is wrong</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Contact details - whatever means the Programme staff will use for
communicating with this person.</li>
<li>Notes - anything else you feel like adding, about this person.</li>
<li>Tags - Each person can have an arbitrary number of tags associated
with them.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
At time of writing, all of this information is entirely separate from the
membership database; the ProgDB can't pull this information out of Richard's
system. Plus, it'll often be the case that you know someone will be doing
something on the programme, but they haven't joined yet, and we have to
cater for that.
</p>

<h3>Listing People</h3>
<p>
You can list people by:
<ol>
<li>Going to the "People" page via the link on the banner, and following
the "List" link</li>
<li>Clicking on "People: List" on the Main page.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<P>
You get a list of people, sorted alphabetically by Real Name (which, note,
isn't separated into first and last names, so you'll get a first-name sort).
</p>
The list includes:
<ul>
<li>The person's name, as a link. Clicking on the link takes you to the
person's record.<li>
<li>You might also see an info icon (<img src=/~steve/images/ProgDBicons/information.jpg>).
This means that there are notes associated with the person. Mousing over the icon will show
you the contents of that note.</li>
<li>Any tags associated with the person. Clicking on a tag takes you to
the tag's page.</li>
<li>A link that <em>might</em> take you to their entry in the membership database,
if they have one. Or it might take you to the membership entry of someone with a
similar surname who joined earlier....</li>
</p>
<p>
Clicking on a person's name shows you their details, plus:
<ul>
<li> All the programme items this person is associated with</li>
<li> All the tags (if any) associated with this person</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
There are also a link that'll take you to the page where you can edit a
person's details, and a link for adding more tags to the person.
</p>

<h3>Creating a new person</h3>
<p>
You can create new people by:
<ol>
<li>Going to the "People" page via the link on the banner, and following
the "Create" link</li>
<li>Clicking on "People: Create" on the Main page.</li>
</ol>
<P>
You get a form that allows you to fill in the Real Name, Badge, Mem Num,
Email, Contact Details and Notes. Everything apart from Real Name is optional.
</p>
<p>
When you click on "Add", you get a page that just says "Inserted" - it's
one of the old, clunky pages, and you have to follow a banner link or
the "Return to main menu" link to do something else. Sorry.
</p>
<h2>Modifying a person's details</h2>
</p>
The "Items for <em>person x</em>" page is accessible from the People:List
links, or most places where you see a person's name. This page, in addition
to listing all their items, has the link to "Edit details' for <em>person x</em>."
</p>
<p>
Just click on the link, modify the details how you'd like, and click on Change.
The details get updated, and you're given a choice of going back to the
person's item list ("View person") or returning to the main menu.
</p>

<h3>Deleting people</h3>
<p>
You can delete people by:
<ol>
<li>Going to the "People" page via the link on the banner, and following
the "Delete" link</li>
<li>Clicking on "People: Delete" on the Main page.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<P>
Both take you to the same form, where you have to select the Person you
want to delete, and there's a confirmation tick-box to ensure you *really*
want to delete them. Click "Delete" to zap them.
</p>
<p>
Deleting a person removes them from any associated tags or programme items.
</p>

<h3>People and Availability</h3>
<p>
This works just like it does for Rooms, so <a href=help_rooms.html>see the
Rooms help</a> for more info.
</p>

<h3>People and programme items</H3>
<p>
This will be covered in <a href=help_items.html>the Items Help page</a>.
</p>

<h3>People and tags</h3>
<p>
This will be covered in <a href=help_tags.html>the Tags Help page</a>.
</p>

<h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>
There's currently no concept of groups of people, like ZZ9, BSFA or
Eclectic-21. That might be added at some point, but for now I suggest
making a fake person with the group's name as the Real Name, and using
tags to link each group's member to the fake name.
