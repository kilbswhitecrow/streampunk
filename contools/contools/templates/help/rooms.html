<h2>Rooms</h2>

<p>
The Rooms link at the top of the page lists all the rooms, in grid order.
Following one of those links in the list will display some information
about the room. At the bottom of the list, there's a link for creating
a new room.
</p>

<h3>Room Attributes</h3>

<p>
Rooms have many, many attributes, just some of which are:
<ul>
<li> Name - How the room is known. This is the name that appears
in Programme Grid pages.</li>
<li> Description - Optional text to identify the room's purpose:
Ops, Green Room, Art Show, etc.</li>
<li> Visible - Whether this room should appear on the Programme
Grids. It defaults to "Yes". Rooms like "Secure Store" should have
this set to "No."</li>
<li> Disabled access - Defaults to "Yes".</li>
<li> Grid order - where this room should appear in the grid, relative to
other rooms (lower numbers appear sooner than higher numbers).</li>
<li> Capacity - By default, a room doesn't have any capacity
associated with it. You can assign one or more capacities, with a
seating layout associated with each.</li>
<li> Availability - Time periods during which the room is available
to the convention. It's a per-con preference whether "no availability
information for this room" should be interpreted as "always available"
or "never available".
</li>
<li> Sub-divisions - A room can be identified as being a sub-part
of another room. For example, The Elizabeth is part of the Royal
suite.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
As it happens, the page that shows the room details doesn't show
anything like all the room info; I really should fix that.
</p>
<h3>Nowhere and Everywhere</h3>
<p>
There are two special pseudo-rooms defined: Nowhere and Everywhere.
</p>
<p>
Nowhere is where programme items are created, by default. It indicates items that don't 
actually have a room yet. It's also a handy place to put items you're not thinking of
actually running. Any item in Nowhere will be considered unscheduled.
</p>
<p>
Everywhere is for items that don't actually need a room - they happen across the con.
A treasure hunt would be an example of this. Items that are scheduled to happen
Everywhere don't collide with other items that happen Everywhere.
</p>
<h3>Items</h3>
<p>
After the room's basic information, there's a list of any items that
are scheduled to take place in that room.
</p>
<h3>Availability</h3>
<p>
The room's availability information is listed, if any has been assigned.
</p>
<h3>Kit Things</h3>
<p>
If any kit has been assigned to the room, either individually or as
part of a kit bundle (see <a href="{% url help_kit %}">Kit</a> for more details),
they'll be listed here too. There are a couple of links, for adding kit
things or bundles to the room.
