<h2>Rooms</h2>
<p>
You can get to the Rooms pages from the banner at the top of most
pages. Your choices are: List, Create, Delete and Availability, and
these are also available on the Main page.
</p>

<h3>Listing Rooms</h3>

<p>
Clicking on "List" will give you a listing of all the rooms currently
defined, showing:
<ul>
<li> The room's name</li>
<li> Any description associated with the room (which is optional).</li>
<li> Any capacities associated with the room, for each seating layout.</li>
<li> The room's <em>grid order</em>. This determines the order in which the rooms are
displayed in the grids: they're displayed in ascending order, from lowest number, to highest.</li>
</ul>
<p>
There's also a link at the bottom of the table for creating new rooms.
<p>
If you click on the room's name, you'll be taken to a page that
displays the room's attributes, plus every programme item scheduled in that room.
<p>
<h3>Room Attributes</h3>

<p>
Rooms have the following attributes:
<ul>
<li> Name - How the room is known. This is the name that appears
in Programme Grid pages.</li>
<li> Description - Optional text to identify the room's purpose:
Ops, Green Room, Art Show, etc.</li>
<li> Visible - Whether this room should appear on the Programme
Grids. It defaults to "Yes". Rooms like "Secure Store" should have
this set to "No."</li>
<li> Disabled access - Defaults to "Yes".</li>
<li> Grid order - where this room should appear in the grid, relative to
other rooms (lower numbers appear sooner than higher numbers).</li>
<li> Capacity - By default, a room doesn't have any capacity
associated with it. You can assign one or more capacities, with a
seating layout associated with each.</li>
<li> Availability - Time periods during which the room is available
to the convention. By default, all rooms are available all the
time.</li>
<li> Sub-divisions - A room can be identified as being a sub-part
of another room. For example, The Elizabeth is part of the Royal
suite.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Creating a room</h3>

<p>
You shouldn't really have to do this (they should be configured by default).
</p>
<p>
To add a new room, do one of the following:
<ul>
<li> From the banner, go to the Rooms page and follow "Create".</li>
<li> Follow the "Rooms: Create" link on the Main page</li>
<li> Click on "Add a new room" at the bottom of the "Rooms" listing.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
All three methods take you to the same page, where you can enter
the Name, (optional) description and grid order, and change the visibility and
disabled access settings. Then click "Add". This being one of the
old, manky facilities, you'll just see "Inserted", and an option
to take you back to the main page. It's not great, but you shouldn't
need it.
</p>

<h3>Specifying Room Capacities</h3>
<p>
List the rooms, and follow the link from the room's name, to the
room's details page. Follow the "Add room capacity" link.
</p>
<p>
This gives you a form: "Set capacity for [ROOM NAME] to [NUMBER]
when laid out as [LAYOUT]".
</p>
<p>
If the [ROOM NAME] is wrong, choose the right room.
</p>
<p>
Chose the [LAYOUT] you want.
</p>
<p>
Enter the number of people the room can take, when in that layout,
then click "Add".
</p>
<p>
You're then given a choice: View the room's details again, or add
another capacity - because a room can have multiple capacities,
each for a different layout.
</p>
<p>
When you view the room's details, any capacities you've specified
will be listed in a table, giving the layout and head-count. Each
also has a "Delete" link, for you to zap that room/capacity setting
should you need to. (Rather than editing a capacity, just delete
the existing one and re-add it with the correct count or layout.)
</p>

<h3>Subdividing rooms</h3>

<p>
List the rooms, and follow the link from the room's name, to the
room's details page. Follow the "Divide up rooms" link.
</p>
<p>
You're given a form: "Make [ROOM NAME] a subcomponent of [ROOM NAME]."
</p>
<p>
Change one or both of the [ROOM NAME] fields to be the combination
you want, and click "Add".
</p>
<p>
You're then given a choice: View the room's details again, or add
another subdivision - because a room will always have more than one
sub-part, if it has any.
</p>
<p>
When you view the room's details, you'll see the room's sub-divisions
listed, along with a "Remove" link to allow you to zap such a
sub-division. You'll see the sub-division from each of the rooms
involved: "this room is a subdivision of [OTHER ROOM]", or "this
room divides into "[A] [B] [C]", as appropriate.
</p>

<h3>Room Availability</h3>

<p>
Availability works like this - either:
<ul>
<li> A room is available for the entire duration or the con</li>
<li> Or it has intermittent periods of availability, each represented
by a start and end time.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, Availability is clunky at present. To get to it, either:
<p>
<ul>
<li> From the banner, go to the Rooms page and follow "Availability".</li>
<li> Follow the "Rooms: Availability" link on the Main page</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
There, you can list all rooms' availabilities, or add new ones.
</p>
<p>
When you choose to add a new availability, you're taken to a form:
"Room [ROOM NAME] available from [START] until [END]".
</p>
<p>
And here's where it's nasty - you have to enter the START and END
times in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format. Sorry about this.
</p>
<p>
The defaults are 7am on the first public day of the con, and midnight
on the last public day.
</p>
<p>
You can delete room availability entries from the Availability listing.
</p>

<h3>Deleting rooms.</h3>

<p>
To delete a room, do one of the following:
<ul>
<li>From the banner, go to the Rooms page and follow "Delete".</li>
<li>Follow the "Rooms: Delete" link on the Main page</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
There, you're presented with a page that allows you to select the
[ROOM NAME] you want to delete. There's a check-box to confirm that
you <em>really</em> want to delete this room, and a "Delete" button.
</p>
<p>
When you delete a room, you'll also delete:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Any capacities for it</li>
<li> Any availabilities</li>
</ul>
<p>
and any programme items associated with the room will lose that association.
</p>

<h3>Nowhere and Everywhere</h3>
<p>
There are two special pseudo-rooms defined: Nowhere and Everywhere.
</p>
<p>
Nowhere is where programme items are created, by default. It indicates items that don't 
actually have a room yet. It's also a handy place to put items you're not thinking of
actually running.
</p>
<p>
Everywhere is for items that don't actually need a room - they happen across the con.
A treasure hunt would be an example of this.
