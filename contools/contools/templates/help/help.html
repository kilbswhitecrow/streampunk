<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome!</p>

<p>Streampunk is a server-based application for developing convention
programmes - what occurs in what room, when, and who's involved in
each item. Streampunk used to be known as <em>ProgDB</em>, or "the
programme database".</p>

<p>Streampunk can offer a number of advantages to convention organisers:
<ul>
<li> Because it's web-based, all staff can get at the live information, directly.
It's not stuck on one person's computer, only distributed at intervals.</li>
<li> Streampunk can check many different aspects of your programme, such as
accidentally putting the same person on two concurrent items, over-scheduling
your guests, or not having a projector in the room for an item that needs one.</li>
<li> Streampunk can sent email to all the people involved in your programme, so
that they can be kept informed of what you have planned for them, without you
having to send each email manually.</li>
<li> Streampunk can provide corresponding printed matter, either directly or in
association with ConText. This includes the programme booklet (or README), drinks
forms for Green Room, labels to stick on the back of badges, door sheets, name
cards to put on the table in front of panellists, etc.
</ul>
</p>

<p>In its previous incarnation as ProgDB, Streampunk was used to plan the
programmes for three Eastercons: Odyssey, Illustrious and Olympus. In
addition to changing name, Streampunk is an entirely new implementation of
the same basic concepts from ProgDB, but with a number of new features:
<ul>
<li> User Authentication: Each user of Streampunk has different access rights,
so some convention staff can have read-only rights, and emails come from the
person sending the email, not a single common user.</li>
<li> Password control: Each user can set their own password, and can get it
reset, too.</li>
<li> A completely new approach to handling Kit (formerly Tech), which should
make managing kit much more straightforward.</li>
<li> A public interface, which hides all the private data. </li>
<li> A much cleaner, open-source implementation, with proper separation of
data model, user-interface interaction, and management.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<em>Please note:</em> This version of Streampunk is very much an alpha release,
for other developers to play with, and to test out the Kit model, etc. It is
<em>not</em> recommended that you try developing your con programme with this
version yet.
