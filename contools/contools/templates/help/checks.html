<h2>Checks</h2>
<p>
There aren't many checks built into the database at present. More will
be added over time.
</p>
<p>
As explained in <a href="{% url "help_basic_concepts" %}">Basic Concepts</a>,
the database doesn't continually check that the programme is consistent.
Instead, it expects that you'll make a whole bunch of changes, and then
ask whether all looks okay once you're complete.
</p>
<p>
Even that's not telling the truth, because there isn't a single "is all
okay" check. Instead, there are several different checks.
</p>
<p>
The currently supported checks are accessible from the "Checks" link at
the top of each page. There's a short description of each.
</p>
<p>
To run a check, tick the checkbox next to the check, then click on
submit. You'll get a page listing any problems found, for each of
the checks you chose to run.
</p>
<p>
Where checks return lists of people, such lists can be saved for
later, or you can choose to email the people.
