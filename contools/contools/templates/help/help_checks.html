<h2>Checks</h2>
There aren't many checks built into the database at present. More will
be added over time.
<p>
As explained in <a href=help_basic_concepts.html>Basic Concepts</a>,
the database doesn't continually check that the programme is consistent.
Instead, it expects that you'll make a whole bunch of changes, and then
ask whether all looks okay once you're complete
<p>
Even that's not telling the truth, because there isn't a single "is all
okay" check. Instead, there are several different checks.
<p>
The currently supported checks are:
<ul>
<li>Programme items that have no people associated with them.</li>
<li>Programme items that don't have an associated room.</li>
<li>People clashes: where the same person is assigned to two items at once.</li>
<li>Room clashes: where there's more than one item in the same room at the same time.</li>
<li>Tech clashes: where the same tech item is assigend to two items at once.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The tech classes check also verifies that uses of a tech item are not outside
the tech item's periods of availability, so I'm guessing that the room and
people clashes also check the same thing.
<p>
I don't recall which check verifies the sequencing constraints (where item
X must be followed by item Y in the same room), but I think I've added that
somewhere.
