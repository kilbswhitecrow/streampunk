<h2>Programme Items</h2>
Programme items - or just <em>items</em> - are the scheduled parts of the programme.
They have the following attributes:
<ul>
<li>Shortname - a simple mnemonic to make it easy to identify the items.</li>
<li>Title - the longer name that appears on the final programme grid.</li>
<li>Blurb - An optional paragraph of text that explains what the item's about</li>
<li>Day - which day the item occurs on.</li>
<li>Start time - when, during the day, the item starts.</li>
<li>Duration - how long the item runs for.</li>
<li>Kind - is it a panel, quiz, talk, workshop, etc.</li>
<li>Visible - should it appear in the programme grids</li>
<li>Expected audience - how many people do you think will turn up?</li>
<li>Gophers - how any gophers does the item need?</li>
<li>Seating - the layout style: theatre, cabaret, etc.</li>
<li>Room - where the item will take place.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In addition to those attributes, there are also several optional attributes:
<ul>
<li>People - who's associated with this time, and in what capacity?</li>
<li>Tech - what tech items does the item need?</li>
<li>Tags - arbitrary categorisation.</li>
<li>Sequencing - indications that two items must be consecutive.</li>
</ul>

<p>
A basic principle is that an item can only occur once, in one place. So, if you
had a programme item that contained several scheduled items on different days,
(first timers' meeting, for example), they'd each be different items.
<p>
Similarly, if you have an item that crosses two separate rooms (and the rooms are
not sub-components of a larger, divided suite of rooms), then you'd identify them
as separate items, again.

<h3>Short names vs Titles</h3>
Items have short names as well as titles. If you look at some of the items in
Redemption '07, you can see why this makes sense:
<table border>
<tr>
<th>Short name</th><th>Title</th>
</tr>
<tr><td>teen shows</td><td>Buffy, Roswell, Smalville - why are the best shows teen shows?</td></tr>
<tr><td>b5 fandom</td><td>The rise and fall of Babylon 5 fandom</td></tr>
<tr><td>tolkien politics</td><td>Legitimacy of political power in Tolkien's universe</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
You can see that the titles can be quite unwieldy, and painful to find in a long list. For example,
are you really going to remember that, in a sorted list, the "teen shows" item begins with "B"?
Plus, the long titles make the grids hard to read. I recommend having the titles for the final
programme booklet, but working exclusively with the short names.

<h3>Creating items</h3>
It's assumed that you'll create programme items in isolation. You'll get vague ideas about them,
over time you'll associate people with them, in varying degrees of certainty, and eventually you'll
drop them into the grid, somewhere. But initially, you won't know when they'll actually be taking
place.
<p>
So, to create a new item, you can do one of the following:
<ol>
<li>Follow the "Items" link on the top banner, then click on "Create"</li>
<li>Click on "Items: Create" on the Main page</li>
</ol>
<p>
Either gets you to "Adding a new item" page. Here you can fill in the basic information about
the item. There are common defaults: most items are assumed to be one-hour panels with no
gophers, about 30 people in the audience, and theatre-style seating. And they're expected to
be visible, so that they appear in the programme grids. In contrast, "main hall setup" might
be a hidden item.
<p>
Note that, at this point, you don't get to assign anybody to the item, or to specify its room.
There <em>are</em> default settings for the date and time, though. I'm not consistent here, in
other words.
<p>
When you click on "Add", you just get told that the item's been added, and are prompted to return
to the main menu. This is one of the old pages, and so the behaviour isn't nice here. But you
can go to the Items page via the top banner link, and List the items; you'll see your new item.

<h3>Listing items</h3>
You'll see lists of items appearing in quite a few places:
<ul>
The programme grids display items that are within their rooms/time lists, of course.
Going to a page for a person or a tag or a tech item will show all the programme items
associated with that particular thing.
The various checks generally list items.
</ul>
<p>
And, of course, you can ask for item lists directly:
<ol>
<li>Follow the "Items" link on the top banner, then click on "List"</li>
<li>Click on "Items: List" on the Main page</li>
</ol>
<p>
The main thing to note about using the Items: List options is that these will show you
<em>all</em> items - regardless of room, day, time, visibility, etc.
<p>
Right now, this list isn't sorted, which is silly - it really should be.
<p>
The entries in the list are all links; clicking on one will take you to the "Edit item"
page, which we'll come to in a bit.

<h3>Moving items</h3>
You'll recall that, initially, items don't have rooms. The easiest way to place an item
into a room at a given day and time is to use the <a href=help_grids.html>programme grid</a>;
you can click on the "Fill slot" button for a given programme grid slot, and then select the
item to put there.
<p>
Alternatively, use the "Edit item" page.

<h3>Editing items</h3>
When you click on an item's link, you're taken to a page which displays all the information
about that item. All the main points, like short name, title, blurb, room, and so on have
"Change" links beside them: clicking on that link will take you to a page that allows you
to edit that particular aspect of the item.
<p>
(I realise this isn't nearly as convenient as, say, editing a person; <em>that</em> gives
you a single form where you can edit what you want, and the save everthing. <em>This</em>
page means you need to do a lot more clicking. I should change that.)
<p>
This page also allows you to change the people, tech, tags and sequencing associated with the
item.
<h3>Adding people to an item</h3>
First thing to note is that you can't add a <em>new</em> person - one not already in the
database - to an item. You have to create the person first - see the <a href=help_people.html>People</a>
page for that.
<p>
The association between an item and people has several attributes:
<ul>
<li>Role - is the person the moderator, a panellist, an interviewer, a gopher, etc. These roles
are configured from the "Manage" part of the Main page.</li>
<li>Status - is how sure you are that the person will be on the item. The database starts out
with "possible" (you've thought of that person), "pending" (you've asked them), and
"Confirmed" (they've agreed). Again, more can be added from the "Manage" part of the main
page.</li>
<li>Show in grid - Not everyone gets listed in the programme grid. The Masquerade might list the
MC, for example, but not the stage manager and gophers.</li>
</ul>
<p>
When you click on "Add", then you can look at the item again, or add another person.

<h3>Removing people from an item</h3>
The page for a given item lists all the people associated with in, along with their
role, status and visibility for that item. Beside each person, there are a couple of
links:
<ul>
<li>Remove - allows you to remove that person from the item (they're not removed from the
database, or from any other items - only the link between the item and the person is
broken).</li>
<li>Edit - allows you to change change all the aspects of the item/person link. This is
basically like adding a new person, overwriting the old one, except that all the settings
default to what they are now. You can change the status, the role, the visibility - even
the person or the item.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Adding tech to an item</h3>
Use the item's details page to add tech equipment to an item. As for adding people,
the tech item must already have been created in the database.
<p>
The "Add tech" page allows you to specify the tech item in question, and the item
to which it should be added. There's also a "setup notes" area, where you can
enter some random text about how that piece of tech should be configured for this
particular item. Maybe the laptop needs to be booted into Windows XP, for example.
<p>
Click on "Add" to save the details.
<p>
When you next look at the programme item, you'll see your piece of tech listed, along
with a "Remove" link.
If you specified any setup notes, they'll also be displayed, along with an "Edit" link.

<h3>Adding tags to an item</h3>
Adding <a href=help_tags.html>tags</a> to an item (or, for that matter, to people) is
simple: from the item's page, click on the "Add tag to this item" link, and you'll be
taken to a page that allows you to "Add [TAG] to [ITEM]". Select the tag you want
(and change the item if you prefer), and click on "Add". You can then either view the
modified item, or add another tag.
<p>
When you view the item, you'll see all the associated tags, in a list. Each has a
"Remove" link beside it.

<h3>Removing tags from an item</h3>
The item's page lists all the associated tags, each with a "Remove" link beside it.
To remove the tag from the item, click on the "Remove" link; it'll be immediately
removed from the item (but the tag itself won't be deleted, and will still be
associated with other items or people, if it was previously).

<h3>Sequencing</h3>
Sequencing constraints indicate that programme item X must be immediately followed
by programme item Y, in the same room. This is used for things like setup and
tear-down. If you make these constraints, and then move one of the items, the other
item won't <em>automatically</em> be moved as well, but you will be able to identify
the constraint no longer applies, by running one of the <a href=help_checks.html>checks</a>.

<p>
To add a sequencing constraint, go to the item's details page, and then click on
"Add sequencing constraint". You'll get a form which says, "follow [ITEM1] with
[ITEM2]." Set the two items as appropriate, and then click "Add"; your constraint
will be added, and then you can view the modified item, or add another constraint.

<p>
When you view the modified item, all the sequencing constraints are listed on the
item's page, each with a "Remove" link beside it. Clicking on "Remove" will delete
the sequencing constraint.
