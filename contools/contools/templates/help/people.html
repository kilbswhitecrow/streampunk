<h2>People</h2>

<p>
People are everybody who appears on the programme in some form. They have
the following attributes:
<ul>
<li>Name - their real name. This is broken into three separate fields,
labelled as <em>First name</em>, <em>Middle name</em> and <em>Last name</em>,
but really you can use them however seems best - as long as at least <em>one</em>
of these three fields is filled in, Streampunk will be happy. The division
is mainly to allow different sort orders.</li>
<li>Badge - their badge name. This is optional, but if specified, this is
what'll be used everywhere in public listings, instead of Name.</li>
<li>Memnum - membership number. As assigned by your membership database, or
-1 if not known. This isn't updated automatically, btw, so if you create
a record for someone who has joined the con, look them up in the membership
database first. If they haven't joined yet, put -1 in. Later, you'll have to
go back and update it with their actual membership number, after they've joined.</li>
<li>Email - their email address. This just should <em>just</em> the email
address, so:
<ul>
<li> fred@site.com is okay</li>
<li> Fred Smith &lt;fred@site.com&gt; is wrong</li>
<li> fred@site.com (Fred Smith) is wrong</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Contact details - whatever means the Programme staff will use for
communicating with this person.</li>
<li>Public  Notes - most likely bio information about guests. This data will be visible
in the public programme.</li>
<li>Gender - You can have any number of different values here, not just Male/Female. Or you
can ignore it entirely. It's here so that you can use it to get a feel of how gender-balanced
your programme is.</li>
<li> Dist email - you should set this to Yes if the person has said they're happy for
the con to distribute their email address to other programme participants, for purposes
of pre-con discussions.</li>
<li>Recording Okay - Set this to Yes if the person has confirmed they're happy to be
recorded, for any and all programme items they might be on.</li>
<li>Complete - use this to indicate that you've got all the information you need from
this person, and that you're not expecting to make any more changes to them.</li>
<li>Tags - Each person can have an arbitrary number of tags associated
with them.</li>
<li>Availability - indicates when they're available for scheduling on programme items.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
At time of writing, all of this information is entirely separate from the
membership database; Streampunk can't pull this information out of Richard's
system. Plus, it'll often be the case that you know someone will be doing
something on the programme, but they haven't joined yet, and we have to
cater for that.
</p>

<h3>Listing People</h3>
<p>
You can list people by:
<ol>
<li>Going to the "People" page via the link on the banner, and following
the "List" link</li>
</ol>
</p>
<P>
You get a list of people, sorted alphabetically by Last Name. Options for
sorting differently will be available later.
</p>
The list includes:
<ul>
<li>The person's name, as a link. Clicking on the link takes you to the
person's record.<li>
<li>A checkbox, with a label that says either "Select?" or "Email/Select?".</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Beneath the list there are four buttons, for emailing all or some people, and for
saving all or some people. The "Some" buttons only apply to those peope you've
checked. The "Email" buttons only apply to those people who actually have an
email address.
</p>
<p>
If you click on the "Email" buttons, you get a form where you can fill in a
subject and message, which will be sent to each of the people on the list.
There are choices to include, for each person:
<ul>
<li> A list of any programme items they're scheduled for</li>
<li> Their contact details</li>
<li> When Streampunk believes they are available</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The "Save" buttons allow you to save this list of people, with a label,
and later come back to it. Most likely, you'll do this for lists of
people that come from checks and reports, but not always.
</p>
<p>
Clicking on a person's name in the list shows you their details, plus:
<ul>
<li> All the programme items this person is associated with</li>
<li> All the tags (if any) associated with this person</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
There are also a link that'll take you to the page where you can edit a
person's details, and a link for adding more tags to the person.
</p>

<h3>Creating a new person</h3>
<p>
You can create new people by:
<ol>
<li>Going to the "People" page via the link on the banner, and following
the "Create" link</li>
</ol>
</p>
<h2>Modifying a person's details</h2>
</p>
The "Items for <em>person x</em>" page is accessible from the People:List
links, or most places where you see a person's name. This page, in addition
to listing all their items, has the link to "Edit person."
</p>
<p>
Just click on the link, modify the details how you'd like, and click on Submit.
The details get updated, and you back to the Person page again.
</p>

<h3>People and Availability</h3>
<p>
This works just like it does for Rooms, so <a href="{% url help_rooms %}">see the
Rooms help</a> for more info.
</p>

<h3>People and programme items</H3>
<p>
This will be covered in <a href="{% url help_items %}">the Items Help page</a>.
</p>

<h3>People and tags</h3>
<p>
This will be covered in <a href="{% url help_tags %}">the Tags Help page</a>.
