<h2>Tech</h2>
Tech is things you can kick: sound desks, DVD players, microphones, flip-charts.
They don't actually have to be <em>tech</em> tech, so a better name might be
"stuff". But it's "tech" at the moment.
<p>
Tech items have the following attributes:
<ul>
<li>Name - identifying a particular, unique item.</li>
<li>Description - to be used however you feel is appropriate.</li>
<li>Notes - again, to be used however.</li>
<li>Class - things like microphones and flip-charts might be interchangeable.</li>
<li>Classes group such things together. You can alter or extend the list of
classes, from the Manage links on the Main page</li>
<li>Department - who's managing this item. Defaults include Ops, Tech, Green Room,
and so on, but you can change this list from the Manage links on the main page.</li>
<li>Source - where the item is coming from. This might be a person who's bringing
their own projector along, or it might be the name of a hire company.</li>
<li>Basis - on what basis does the con have access to this item? Borrow, Own and
Hire are the defaults.</li>
<li>Cost - If this is costing the con some money, record it here, to help with your
budgeting.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition, tech items are generally associated with one or more programme items.
<p>
The idea behind the Source/Basis settings is that some things, like most of the
Main Hall tech, will be hired for the con, while other things might be borrowed
from friendly fans, and a third category of items might be bought out of con
funds as a more-or-less disposible item (printers, laminators, etc.) Together
with costs, you can use these classifications to see how much your tech is costing
your con.

<h3>Creating new tech items</h3>
To create a tech item, either
<ul>
<li>Go to the "Tech" page from the banner, and follow "Create"</li>
<li>Follow "Tech: Create" on the Main page</li>
</ul>
<p>
Both will take you to a form where you can fill in all of the above
attributes, but the Name is the most important one. If you've got (or
expect to have) lots of items of a given class, then name them differently:
"Microphone 1", "Radio Mic 4", "Flip-Chart 12", etc.
<p>
The suggestion for Description versus Notes is that a description will tell
you <em>what</em> it is, while, notes will tell you something about it:
"Uses 3 AAA batteries", or "Plays region 2 only".
<p>
When you've filled everything in, click on "Add". You can return to the main
menu, or you can add another.

<h3>Listing tech items</h3>
You'll see tech item lists appearing on programme item pages - where such
programme items make use of tech items, that is. To list <em>all</em> the
known tech items, either:
<ul>
<li>Go to the "Tech" page from the banner, and follow "List"</li>
<li>Follow "Tech: List" on the Main page</li>
</ul>
<p>
You'll see all of the tech items, along with their descriptions (if any).
<p>
Clicking on each tech item's name will take you to the page for that item.
There, you'll see all the programme items to which the tech item is assigned,
and there'll be a link to edit the tech item's details.
<h3>Deleting tech items</h3>
To delete a tech item (so that the tech item no longer exists):
<ul>
<li>Go to the "Tech" page from the banner, and follow "Delete"</li>
<li>Follow "Tech: Delete" on the Main page</li>
</ul>
You'll get a page which allows you to select the tech item you want to delete.
You have to tick the "really delete" check-box before clicking on the "Delete"
button, to confirm that you really want to zap it.
<p>
When a tech item is deleted, it's first removed from any associated programme items.

<h3>Adding tech items to programme items</h3>
This is covered in the <a href=help_items.html>Programme Items</a> help page.
