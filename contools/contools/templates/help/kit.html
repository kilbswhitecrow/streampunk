<h2>Kit</h2>
<p>
Kit is things you can kick: sound desks, DVD players, microphones, flip-charts.
It frequently means Tech equipment, but it doesn't have to.
</p>

<p>
There are three aspects that are relevant here:
<ul>
<li> Kit Things: Actual instances of equipment, considered as indivisible.</li>
<li> Kit Bundles: Collections made up of kit things.</li>
<li> Kit Requests: A statement of requirement that needs satisfying.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Kit Things</h3>
<p>
Kit things are the basic units of equipment management. A single Thing represents
some equipment entity that you're going to manage as a single unit. It might actually
<em>be</em> one thing, such as a projector screen, or it might be a collection of
units that you always keep together through-out the con, such as a pair of speakers
and the corresponding cabling.
</p>

<p>
Kit things have the following attributes, among others:
<ul>
<li>Name - identifying a particular, unique item. If you have multiple
instances of a piece of kit, and you're going to manage them separately,
give them different, useful names. "Main hall screen", "video room screen", etc.</li>
<li>Description - to be used however you feel is appropriate.</li>
<li>Notes - again, to be used however.</li>
<li>Kind - This is a categorisation of the kit thing. For example, you might have
"Microphone" and "Projector". Note, however, that all things of a given kind should
be essentially interchangeable. If you need a microphone, and don't care whether it's
a cable mic or a radio mic, then "Microphone" would work. If, however, you actually
want a radio mic at some point, then you should distinguish them.</li>
<li>Count - Kit things can actually be multiple instances of that thing, as long as:
<ul>
<li> they're the same <em>kind</em> of thing;
<li> and you always manage them together </li>
</ul>
This is most likely to be useful for microphone sets, but you can use it for any thing.</li>
<li>Department - who's managing this item. Defaults include Ops, Tech, Green Room,
and so on, but you can change this list.</li>
<li>Source - where the item is coming from. This might be a person who's bringing
their own projector along, or it might be the name of a hire company.</li>
<li>Basis - on what basis does the con have access to this item? Borrow, Own and
Hire are the defaults.</li>
<li>Cost - If this is costing the con some money, record it here, to help with your
<li>Insurance - if this thing should be covered in the con's insurance, value it here.</li>
budgeting.</li>
<li>Availability - as with <a href="{% url help_rooms %}">Rooms</a> and <a href="{% url help_people %}">People</a>, you can record when the thing is available to the con, so that you don't
schedule its use outside of that period (or periods).</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can assign kit things to specific items, in which case the thing will be considered in
use for the duration of that item. Alternatively, you can assign a kit thing to a room
for a duration covering multiple items, in which case the thing will be considered
available for use by any item taking place in that room.
</p>
<h3>Kit Bundles</h3>
<p>
As mentioned above, each Kit Thing is considered indivisible, but sometimes you have
multiple items and you want to manage them together. Or you have multiple items of
different kinds.
</p>
<p>
Kit Bundles are collections of Kit things. They have:
<ul>
<li>A name (again, make this descriptive). </li>
<li>A status, for management.</li>
<li>A list of kit things that make up the bundle.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
So you can take a set of microphones, an amp system, a sound desk, a laptop, a
projector and a screen, each of which are separate kit things, and wrap them
all up as a single bundle. You can then assign that bundle to an item or to
a room, and the effect is to assign all the items in the bundle together, for
the same duration.
</p>
<h3>Kit Requests</h3>
<p>
A Kit request is an indication that an item needs some kit. The attributes of
a kit request are:
<ul>
<li>Kind - e.g. Microphone, screen, laptop. </li>
<li>Count - if more than one thing is needed, of this kind. </li>
<li>Setup Assistance - whether the people on the item will need a member of Tech Crew 
on hand to get everything working. </li>
<li>Miscellaneous notes </li>
<li>A status </li>
</ul>
<p>
So the idea here is that Tech Crew can read the descriptions of the items that
have been entered by programme staff, and translate their indecipherable ramblings
into actual kit requests: A set of 4 microphones, and a laptop, say.
</p>
<p>
When kit things are assigned to an item (either directly or as part of a bundle),
then they can satisfy a kit request of that item, if they match the kind, and 
have a sufficiently large count.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, if an item is scheduled in a particular room, then the item's
kit requests can be satisfied by any things that are assigned to the room
at that time.
</p>
<p>
Streampunk can run <a href="{% url help_checks %}">checks</a> to tell you
when an item has kit requests that are currently not satisfied either directly
or by kit assigned to the item's room.
