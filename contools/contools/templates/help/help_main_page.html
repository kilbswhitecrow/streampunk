<h2>Main page</h2>
<p>
The main page can be found <a href=menu.php>here</a>.
</p>

<p>
It has two main components: the grids, and "Other Tools".
</p>

<h3>Grids</h3>
<p>
The grids are explained in more detail <a href=grids.html>elsewhere</a>,
but the basic idea is:
<ul>
<li> There's a row for each day of the con, <em>including non-public days</em>. </li>
<li> Each row is split into individual chunks of time (four hours in length, by default).
Clicking on one of those chunks will show you a programme grid for that period of time. </li>
<li> At the far right of each row, there's a button for a grid for the whole day. </li>
<li> Beneath the table of grids, there's a button for "Entire grid". That'll list your entire
programme in one go. </li>
</ul>
You can use the grid pages to move existing items around. Once the database has a large
number of items, you'll probably use this a lot.
</p>

<H3>Other Tools</h3>
<p>
This part of the page gives you links to the pages where you can access, create and generally
fiddle around with the contents of the database.
</p>

<p>
The first part is concerned with the main kinds of data in the database: people, items, rooms,
tags and tech. For each of them, you've got three or four choices:
<ul>
<li> <em>List</em> - list the people/items/whatever that are already entered (which gives you
links to the editing features).</li>
<li> <em>Create</em> - Create a new person/item/whatever from scratch.</li>
<li> <em>Delete</em> - Delete one of the existing people, items, rooms, etc. Rare that you'll
need this.</li>
<li> <em>Availability</em> - Set up or alter the availability of something. This is
<a href=availability.html>explained in more detail elsewhere</a>, but the basic idea is that,
usually people, rooms and tech are available for the entire con, but this might not always be
the case, so where necessary, you can configure the periods when something is available - then,
later, you can run a check to ensure that it/he/she is not required outside those periods.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>

The next part - items/people, items/rooms, items/tech - is where you can run basic checks, or
change the relationships between items and people, rooms or tech.
<ul>
<li> Items/People
<ul>
<li> <em>(missing people)</em> - Will show you items that don't have anyone attached.</li>
<li> <em>People clashes</em> - Will show you where the same person is attached to more than one
item at the same time. Also shows when someone isn't available for a programme item. </li>
<li> <em>(by person)</em> -Lists programme items, by person (all Bob's items, then all Carol's, and so on).</li>
<li> <em>(by item)</em> -Lists people, by programme item (all the people on item X, then all the people on item Y, and so on.).</li>
<li> <em>(people by item count)</em> -Lists people, giving the number of programme items to which they're attached. The list is sorted so that the most heavily-scheduled people are listed first.</li>
<li> <em>(programmed people not joined)</em> -Lists people who are attached to programme items, but for which the database doesn't yet have a membership number (i.e. their membership number is -1). It's possible (even likely) that they've joined, but their membership number hasn't been added to their entry in the programme database.</li>
<li> <em>Add person to item</em> - Allows you to add a person to an existing item. You can also do this
directly from the item.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Items/rooms
<ul>
<li> <em>(missing a room)</em> - Will show you all the items that aren't currently allocated to a given room, and will tell you how many items are allocated to <em>Nowhere</em>, the pseudo-room.</li>
<li> <em>Room clashes</em> - Will show you where more than one item occupies the same room during the same time slot.</li>
<li> <em>Change an item's room</em> - Move an item from one room to another. Easiest done on the grids.</li>
<li> <em>Change an item's start day/time</em> - Allows you to specify a new day and start time for an item. Easiest
done on the grids.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Items/tech
<ul>
<li> <em>Tech clashes</em> - Will show you any cases where the same item of tech is assigned to two programme
items at the same time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The final part - Manage - allows you to fiddle with the bits and pieces that tie everything together, but which
don't normally need to change.
<ul>
<li> <em>Seating Layouts</em> - Are how rooms are laid out, e.g. theatre style, cabaret, boardroom.
Used when configuring room capacities, and for specifying how a given programme item's room should be
laid out. Here's where you'd go to add another one - for example, you might want to add a new layout,
for "chairs in a circle".</li>
<li> <em>Item kinds</em> - Things like Panel, Quiz, Talk, Workshop, and so on. You might want to add
"Tour", "Training", "Setup", etc.</li>
<li> <em>Tech classes</em> - For some kinds of tech, you'll have numerous instances of them, and they're
assigned classes. Flip-charts, microphones, laptops, etc.</li>
<li> <em>Tech sources</em> - Are where you get the tech items from. Stage Electrics might be one source,
and Chris O'Shea or Eddie Cochrane might be a couple more.</li>
<li> <em>Tech basis</em> - Currently includes Borrow, Hire and Own</li>
<li> <em>Departments</em> - Who the item of tech is assigned to. Ops, Stewards, Green Room, etc.</li>
<li> <em>People roles</em> - When a person is associated with a programme item, they do so in a particular role,
such as Moderator, Participant, Quizmaster, Scorer, Gopher.</li>
<li> <em>People statuses</em> - Currently includes Possible, Pending and Confirmed, and indicates how solid
the person's association with the item is, at present.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
When you modify any of these categories, you can also specify which one is the default. Generally, Judith has the default set to "TBA".
