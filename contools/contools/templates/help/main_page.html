<h2>Main Page</h2>

<p>
The main page can be found <a href="{% url main_page %}">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
There's not a lot on the main page yet. In the original ProgDB, I piled
lots of links onto the main page, because there wasn't really anywhere
else to put them. Chances are, Streampunk will have a better arrangement,
but we'll wait and see.
</p>

<p>
At the moment, it displays some basic information about the programme
as it currently stands:
<ul>
<li> The name of the convention (as retrieved from ConInfoString).</li>
<li> the number of scheduled items (this count excludes <em>unscheduled</em> items).</li>
<li> The number of scheduled hours (i.e. the sum of the durations of the scheduled items).</li>
<li> The total of the budget fields for all scheduled items.</li>
<li> The number of people who are scheduled on at least one item.</li>
<li> The total number of times anyone is scheduled on an item (three people scheduled on two
     items each would count as six).</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>There are also a small number of links to tools; this is likely to change over time:
<ul>
<li> Add a person to an item.</li>
<li> Add multiple tags to multiple items and/or people, at the same time.</li>
<li> Set up group permissions. This is a special tool for configuring user permissions
after re-installing the basic data; this'll probably go somewhere else in time.</li>
</ul>
</p>
