<h2>Admin</h2>
<p>
The Admin page is part of the facilities provided by Django, the system
upon which Streampuk is based. It's a management GUI that allows you to
do many things which aren't currently possible directly from Streampunk's
own pages:
<ul>
<li> List all object tables (items, people, kit bundles, etc.) </li>
<li> Create new objects in the tables</li>
<li> View and edit existing objects in the tables</li>
<li> Delete objects from the tables</li>
<li> Create new Users, administer access rights, etc. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Access to the Admin interface is restricted to users that are "Staff",
or to "superusers". The plan is that, for some of the Streampunk objects,
I'm just going to let the Admin GUI handle all the heavy lifting. This
applies to the per-con configuration data:
<ul>
<li> ConDays, Slots, SlotLengths and Grids </li>
<li> Rooms and Capacities</li>
<li> Enumerations, such as ItemKind, PersonRole, SeatingKind, etc. </li>
<li> Users and Groups</li>
<li> Con preferences: ConInfoString, ConInfoBool, ConInfoInt.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Most of these won't change very often - you set them up at the start of
the con, and then keep them basically as-is. Chances are, a lot of the
default data that comes with Streampunk might do you perfectly well.
</p>
<p>
This is the kind of thing the Admin GUI is designed to address: the
normal pages offer the day-to-day user experience, while the Admin GUI
provides you will the tools to go in and make the changes and corrections
that are necessary. There's a corresponding assumption that you know
what you are doing.
