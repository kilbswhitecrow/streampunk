<h2>Basic Concepts</h2>
<H3>Rooms, People and Items</h3>
<p>
The three core concepts of Streampunk are rooms, people and items:
<ul>
<li> <em>Rooms</em> are the physical rooms within the venue, where con stuff takes place.
They can be subdivided, be listed on programme booklet grids or be private, have certain layouts and capacities,
and so on.</li>
<li> <em>People</em> are the named participants of programme items. Panel members, moderators,
quiz master, and so on.</li>
<li> <em>Items</em> are the scheduled events in the programme: the Opening Ceremony would be
one, as would Torchwood Wobblevision. Items occur in a particular <em>Room</em> at a
particular time, for a given duration, and can have <em>people</em> associated with them, in
various roles.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Generally, speaking, you start off with a database that contains a load of pre-configured
Rooms, and no Items or People. You enter items and people separately,
then you assign people to items, and assign items to rooms and to timeslots in the programme.
</p>

<h3>Grids and slots</h3>
<p>
Slots are the times when an item can start. You can have as many different slots as you
want, down to the resolution of a minute. Typically, slots would be on the hour, or the
half-hour, or every 90 minutes, as fits your programme.</p>

<p>
There's a day for each day of the con, and each of those days has 
the same layout of slots.</p>

<p>
There are also pre-configured item durations, e.g. half an hour, one hour,
two hours or three hours. Note that these are the <em>pre-configured</em> choices - if you
need a greater variety, or longer or shorter items, that can be done.
</p>

<p>
The database also knows about non-public days of the con - those days before the con starts
and those days after the con ends. For example, you might be scheduling set-up and tear-down
items, but you wouldn't normally include them in the public version of the programme.
</p>

<p>
A concept taken from Redemption is the <em>Grid</em>. The Redemption programme booklet
lists the programme in four-hour chunks, e.g. Friday 2pm-6pm, Friday 6pm-10pm. Streampunk
has a similar concept, in that it has groupings of consecutive slots for displaying
items in a grid format. <em>This is just for presentation purposes</em>, because if you
keep asking the database to display six days worth of grid, there's a lot of scrolling in your
browser.
</p>

<h3>Tags</h3>
<p>
Tags are an arbitrary linking system. The assumption is that you're occasionally going to want
to, say, find all items relating to Star Trek, or all items that are about movies, or all
the committee members, or all the guests, and so on.
</p>

<p>
Tags are very simple: they have a name, a description, and a flag to say whether the
tag public, and you can add as many as you want.
Then they can be assigned to people, and to programme items. When you look at a programme item,
you see the tags associated with it. You can follow a given tag to see all the other programme
items with that tag, or all the people that have it.
</p>

<H3>Kit</h3>
<p>
Kit is the physical
stuff that get moved from room to room as required. Microphones, laptops, screens, flip-charts,
and so on. If an item needs some kit, such as a screen and a projector, you associate a
<em>kit request</em> with the item. This says, "this item should not be considered sorted
until these requests have been satisfied". Kit <em>things</em> are the actual physical pieces of
equipment; you can assign them directly to items, in which case they can satisfy the item's
requests, or you can assign them to rooms, in which case they can satisfy the requests of
any items that take place in that room.
</p>


<h3>Data entry and checking</h3>
<p>
The philosophy here is that programmes develop over time, and that you don't create a programme
in its final state immediately. You'll hear about ideas for programme items, and have vague
thoughts as to who'd be involved, but you don't know all the people when you first enter the
programme item into the database. Nor do you usually know which room it'll be in, or in which
time-slot.
</p>

<p>
It's also assumed that, periodically, you'll have to go through hefty periods of rearrangement:
Bob can't make Saturday, so his items all have to move, and now the fireworks display can't be
in the main hall, and that means the cold fusion demonstration has to get bumped to another slot,
and so on. Chances are, while you're moving things around, you'll be continually creating
programmes that are "inconsistent" - two items in the same room, or the same person being assigned
to two different programme items in different rooms at the same time. These are okay; it's assumed
that you'll move A to B, then X to Y, where the first action creates a conflict, and the second
fixes it.
</p>

<p>
Because of this expectation, Streampunk doesn't continually check whether each action creates
a problem. Instead, the assumption is that, once you've finished, you can tell Streampunk,
"please let me know about any problems," and <em>then</em> it'll furtle through all
your info and see what's what.
</p>

<p>
(Also, the kind of checks we're talking about are computationally expensive, since everything
has to be checked against everything else, and that's not something you want to have happen every
time you make a little change.)
</p>

<h3>Enum tables and values</h3>
<p>
Streampunk has a lot of list of values for different things:
room layout, person roles, media status, etc. Each of these things
is just a list of values, with names associated with them, and you
can have as many different values for each thing as you'd like. So,
you might just have item types of Panel and Talk, or you might have
Exercise and Workshop and Dance and Competition and Quiz and... well,
whatever.
</p>
<p>
Generally, there are no semantics attached to any of these items - they're
just ways for you to distinguish your programme. But each list has a couple
of fields that are important:
<ul>
<li> Is Default -  indicate that when you're creating a new object in the
database, this is the default value that this field should get.</il>
<li> Is Undefined - indicates that this value should be interpreted as
"No value defined for this field".</il>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Both of these values should be set for <em>exactly one</em> value in a
given field's list of values. They need not be set on the same one,
though. So you might say that the undefined value for item type
is "To be decided", but the default value is "Panel".
</p>
<p>
The idea here is that you can choose whether, for your con, a particular
field should default to the most likely useful value, or whether it
should default to an undefined value, thereby requiring you to explcitly
choose it rather than just blithely accepting the default.
</p>
<p>
This concept also applies in other areas beyond these simple enumerations.
One room can be marked as the default room, and another (or the same one)
as the undefined room; when items are assigned to the latter, the
item is considered unscheduled. Similarly, there are other checks that
can report when a field is (still) set to the undefined value.
</p>
<h3>Visible</h3>
<p>
A number of constructs have a <em>visible</em> attribute. This is used
to indicate whether the object in question is public. The idea is that
you'll have various admininstration parts of your event that are necessary
for smooth running, and which need scheduling, but which you don't want to
tell everyone about. Rooms, items, people's attendance on them, etc. default
to being visible, but if you mark them as not-visible, then they won't
appear on printed versions of the programme.
</p>
<h3>Other bits</h3>
<p>
This page has just touched on the main concepts of Streampunk. There are other things that'll be
introduced at the appropriate time. So don't be thinking, "harmuph, I need feature X, and there's
been no mention of it yet!" Because there's a lot that hasn't been mentioned yet. Be patient.
