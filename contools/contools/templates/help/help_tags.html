<h2>Tags</h2>
Tags are arbitrary grouping mechanisms. The intent is that they're public, but this
need not be the case. Each tag has:
<ul>
<li>A name</li>
<li>A description</li>
</ul>
<p>
and tags can be associated with programme items and people.
<p>
For example, you might want tags for:
<ul>
<li>Movies</li>
<li>Books</li>
<li>Comics</li>
<li>Blake's 7</li>
<li>Life on Mars</li>
<li>Fandom</li>
<li>Chaos</li>
<li>Children's programme</li>
<li>Science stream</li>
</ul>
and you might have tags for:
<ul>
<li>Committee</li>
<li>Tech crew</li>
<li>guests</li>
<li>Stewards</li>
<li>Green Room</li>
<li>Eclectic-21</li>
<li>ZZ9</li>
</ul>
<p>
It doesn't really matter - it's up to you. The point is, the database, by design,
allows you to, say, "list all items that Fiona Scarlett is associated with", or
"All items that Liz Williams is on", but not "All the items that have any guests
on them"...
<p>
....well, okay, actually, it could, but there isn't a page for that, yet, so...
<p>
...so you can create tags for whatever you like, assign them to programme items
and/or people, and then find all the items or people that are associated with
that tag. That's <em>it</em>, but used properly, it could be very powerful
(and very handy to members).
<p>
Enough pontificating.
<h3>Creating tags</h3>
You can create tags either:
<ol>
<li>By going to the "Tags" page from the banner, then following "Create"</li>
<li>By following "Tags: Create" on the Main page</li>
</ol>
<p>
When you do, you're prompted to enter the tag's name and description (the latter's
optional). Then you click on "Add", and your tag is created.
<p>
Being an old page, clicking on Add just tells you that the tag has been created,
and to go back to the main page.

<h3>Listing tags</h3>
You can list all the tags either:
<ol>
<li>By going to the "Tags" page from the banner, then following "List"</li>
<li>By following "Tags: List" on the Main page</li>
</ol>
<p>
Tags are listed in alphabetical order, with descriptions.
<p>
Each entry in this list is a link that'll take you to the tag's page, where:
<ul>
<li>You can Edit the tag (see below)</li>
<li>Any programme items associated with the tag are listed</li>
<li>Any people associated with the tag are listed</li>
</ul>

<h3>Editing tags</h3>
Whenever a tag appears, you can click on the tag (it's a link), and you'll
go to the tag's page. There, you'll find a link to "Edit this tag". Following
<em>that</em> link gives you a page where you can update the tag's name or
description. Click on "Change" to save your changes.

<h3>Removing tags from things</h3>
If you want to remove a tag from a programme item or a person, click on the
link of the respective thing; that'll take you to the programme item or person
page, where all associated tags are listed. Click on the "Remove" link next to
the tag to remove the tag from the programme item or person.

<h3>Deleting tags</h3>
You can delete a tag (so that the tag no longer exists):
<ol>
<li>By going to the "Tags" page from the banner, then following "Delete"</li>
<li>By following "Tags: Delete" on the Main page</li>
</ol>
<p>
Both give you a form where you can select the tag you want to delete. You have
to tick the "Really delete" tick-box too, then click on "Delete".
<p>
When a tag is deleted, it's first removed from any programme items or people.
