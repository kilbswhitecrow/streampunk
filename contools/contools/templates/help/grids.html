<h2>Grids</h2>
<p>
The Grids page shows the names of each of the configured grids, for
each day of the convention. Clicking on one of them will show a page
specific to that grid.
</p>

<h3>Slots</h3>
<p>
The slots in the current grid are displayed, along with information
about that slot. This isn't really useful, and will probably be
removed. But note that you can click on a slot's link, and that'll
show you a page which lists the items in the slot.
</p>

<p>
For each slot, the information displayed is:
<ul>
<li> The slot's name, with a link.</li>
<li> the stot's starting point - this is an offset from Midnight, in minutes.</li>
<li> The duration of the slot.</li>
<li> The slot's name, again...</li>
<li> The text that describes the period of time covered by the slot.</li>
<li> Whether the slot should appear in the public programme.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>The grid</h3>
<p>
The grid shows a table of rooms vs time-slots. The orientation can vary.
</p>

<p>
By default, grid lists the Rooms down the Y axis, and time along the X axis,
in the manner of Redemption's Programme Booklet. This default is configurable
on a con-by-con basis.
</p>

<p>
Rooms are listed by their <em>grid order</em> (see <a href="{% url "help_rooms" %}">Rooms</a>); this is more convenient than, say, alphabetical, because it means the most commonly-used rooms are the first you see.
</p>

<p>
In the public programme, rooms are only listed if they are marked as visible.
</p>


<p>

Each cell on the grid will show one of two things:

<ul>
<li> If there are programme items assigned to this room at this time,
they'll be listed. There may be multiple item using the room at any
one time (if you're partway through rearranging things), so all
will be shown.</li>

<li> Cells also have a "Fill slot" button, which allows you to
assign already-existing items to this time slot.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>

Programme grids can display items in lots of modes: beneath the grid,
there are links to:
<ul>
<li> Switch the orientation (rooms down size, vs rooms along top) </li>
<li> Hide or show people </li>
<li> Hide or show the "Fill slot" link. </li>
</ul>
More options will be forthcoming in the future.
</p>

</p>
<h3>Fill Slot</h3>
<p>
When you click on "Fill Slot", you're presented with a new page.
The page has a drop-down list
to allow you to select the programme item you want to move. The
list shows all the unscheduled items, sorted by title; there's
also a link to change the list so that it includes all items
(both scheduled and unscheduled).
</p>

<p>
When you've found the item you want to position there,
you click the "Submit" button, and the programme item will be moved,
and you'll go back to the grid page.
</p>
