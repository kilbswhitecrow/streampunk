{% block title %}About Streampunk{% endblock %}
{% block body_content %}
<p>Streampunk is an application for developing programmes for conventions, conferences, etc.
It allows you to schedule items in rooms, and allocate people to those items. It can tell
you when you've gotten things wrong. And it can generally make your life easier, if you
use it in the correct way.</p>

<p>Streampunk is written and maintained by Stephen Kilbane. Assistance is welcomed.</p>

<p>Past history: Streampunk was originally known as ProgDB; the name-change is part of
the rewrite in Django, and of the migration to an Open-Source system.</p>
