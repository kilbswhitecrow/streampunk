<h2>Tags</h2>

Tags are arbitrary grouping mechanisms.  Each tag has:
<ul>
<li>A name</li>
<li>A description</li>
<li>A flag, indicating whether it is visible in the public programme</li>
<li>An optional icon URL</li>
</ul>
<p>
and tags can be associated with programme items and people.
<p>
For example, you might want tags for:
<ul>
<li>Movies</li>
<li>Books</li>
<li>Comics</li>
<li>Blake's 7</li>
<li>Life on Mars</li>
<li>Fandom</li>
<li>Chaos</li>
<li>Children's programme</li>
<li>Science stream</li>
</ul>
and you might have tags for:
<ul>
<li>Committee</li>
<li>Tech crew</li>
<li>guests</li>
<li>Stewards</li>
<li>Green Room</li>
<li>Eclectic-21</li>
<li>ZZ9</li>
</ul>
<p>
It doesn't really matter - it's up to you. The point is, the database, by design,
allows you to, say, "list all items that Buffy Summers is associated with", or
"All items that Xander Harris is on", but not "All the items that have any guests
on them"...
<p>
....well, okay, actually, it could, but there isn't a page for that, yet, so...
<p>
...so you can create tags for whatever you like, assign them to programme items
and/or people, and then find all the items or people that are associated with
that tag. That's <em>it</em>, but used properly, it could be very powerful
(and very handy to members).
<p>
Enough pontificating.
<h3>Creating tags</h3>
You create tags by going to the "Tags" page from the banner, then following "New tag"</li>
<p>
When you do, you're prompted to enter the tag's name and description (the latter's
optional). Then you click on "Add", and your tag is created.
<p>
If you want the tag to have an ion as well, enter the URL of the icon. Note:
icons should be <em>small</em>, so that they don't consume a lot of real estate
on the screen.
<p>
<h3>Editing tags</h3>
Whenever a tag appears, you can click on the tag (it's a link), and you'll
go to the tag's page. There, you'll find a link to "Edit tag". Following
<em>that</em> link gives you a page where you can update the tag's name or
description. Click on "Submit" to save your changes.
