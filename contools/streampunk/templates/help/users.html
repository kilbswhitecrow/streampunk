<h2>Users</h2>
<p>
Streampunk has support for Users and Groups. The intent is that there will
be several levels of user:
<ul>
<li> Superusers - full access to everything </li>
<li> Admins - full read and write access. Can use the <a href="{% url "help_admin" %}">Admin GUI</a>.</li>
<li> Con committee, dept heads - can read and write everything through the normal pages.</li>
<li> Con staff - can read everything, but not change it.</li>
<li> Members - can read public things, but not private. Can't change anything. Can send email to programme participants.</li>
<li> Everyone else - Can read public data</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
So, long-term, there's potential for running your Streampunk server as a publicly-accessible
site, where each member of the con has been allocated their own User account which allows
them to send emails to each other, and people who have not yet signed up for the con can
still read the programme info that's visible. But all that's in the future.
</p>
<h3>Default configuration</h3>
<p>
When you create a Streampunk installation, default data gets loaded, and you're prompted to
create a superuser account. The setup does create some access permissions, but not the
role-based ones described above. So when you look at the data through the normal pages,
you won't have any permissions to see any private data (i.e. anything with <em>visible</em>
set to False). None of the editing links will appear.
</p>
<p>
If you log in as your superuser account, then all the private data and edit links appear, because superusers
get all permissions, automatically.
</p>
<p>
At this point, you should click on <a href="{% url "make_con_groups" %}">Set up all the group permissions</a> on the <a href="{% url "main_page" %}">Main page</a>. (Note: if you've also installed the demo data that comes with Streampunk, then
this has already been done for you.) This will install a bunch of additional permissions that Streampunk uses:
<ul>
<li> Read_public </li>
<li> Read_private</li>
<li> Edit_programme</li>
<li> Edit_kit</li>
<li> ...</li>
</ul>
and so on. These are the permissions that Streampunk uses to determine whether it's okay to
display information, or whether to allow the current user to edit the data.
</p>
<p>
Once these permissions are set up, when you create new users through the
<a href="{% url "help_admin" %}">Admin GUI</a>, you can allocate appropriate permissions to them.
You can also set up groups (con staff, programme staff, tech crew, etc.) and allocate the
permissions to them, instead, which will make it easier when you create new users.</p>
