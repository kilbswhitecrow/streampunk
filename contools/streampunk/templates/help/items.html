<h2>Items</h2>

Programme items - or just <em>items</em> - are the scheduled parts of the programme.
They have the following attributes, among a bunch of others:
<ul>
<li>Shortname - a simple mnemonic to make it easy to identify the items.</li>
<li>Title - the longer name that appears on the final programme grid.</li>
<li>Blurb - An optional paragraph of text that explains what the item's about. This is intended for the printed programme.</li>
<li>Slot - the day and time at which the item starts.</li>
<li>Length - how long the item runs for.</li>
<li>Kind - is it a panel, quiz, talk, workshop, etc.</li>
<li>Room - where the item will take place.</li>
<li>Visible - should it appear in the programme grids</li>
<li>Expected audience - how many people do you think will turn up?</li>
<li>Gophers - how any gophers does the item need?</li>
<li>Seating - the layout style of the room: theatre, cabaret, etc.</li>
<li>Front layout - the layout style at the front of the room - desk with chairs, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In addition to those attributes, there are also several optional attributes:
<ul>
<li>People - who's associated with this time, and in what capacity?</li>
<li>Tech - what tech items does the item need? There are <em>many</em> attributes
related to Tech and other Kit - see <a href="{% url "help_kit" %}">Kit</a> for
more details.</li>
<li>Tags - arbitrary categorisation.</li>
<li>Sequencing - indications that two items must be consecutive.</li>
</ul>

<p>
A basic principle is that an item can only occur once, in one place. So, if you
had a programme item that contained several scheduled items on different days,
(first timers' meeting, for example), they'd each be different items.
<p>
Similarly, if you have an item that crosses two separate rooms (and the rooms are
not sub-components of a larger, divided suite of rooms), then you'd identify them
as separate items, again.

<h3>Short names vs Titles</h3>
Items have short names as well as titles. If you look at some of the items in
Redemption '07, you can see why this makes sense:
<table border>
<tr>
<th>Short name</th><th>Title</th>
</tr>
<tr><td>teen shows</td><td>Buffy, Roswell, Smalville - why are the best shows teen shows?</td></tr>
<tr><td>b5 fandom</td><td>The rise and fall of Babylon 5 fandom</td></tr>
<tr><td>tolkien politics</td><td>Legitimacy of political power in Tolkien's universe</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
You can see that the titles can be quite unwieldy, and painful to find in a long list. For example,
are you really going to remember that, in a sorted list, the "teen shows" item begins with "B"?
Plus, the long titles make the grids hard to read. I recommend having the titles for the final
programme booklet, but working exclusively with the short names. However, the use of shortnames
is optional - it's a con-wide preference whether to display them. (It's the "show shortnames"
variable that appears on the main page.)
</p>

<h3>Creating items</h3>
It's assumed that you'll create programme items in isolation. You'll get vague ideas about them,
over time you'll associate people with them, in varying degrees of certainty, and eventually you'll
drop them into the grid, somewhere. But initially, you won't know when they'll actually be taking
place.
<p>
So, to create a new item follow the "Items" link on the top banner, then click on "New item".
<p>
This gets you to "Adding a new item" page. Here you can fill in the basic information about
the item. Many fields have default values, but exactly what those defaults are is dependent
on the local con configuration - see <a href={% url "help_basic_concepts" %}">Basic Concepts</a>.
</p>
<p>
Note that, at this point, you don't get to assign anybody to the item.
</p>

<h3>Listing items</h3>
You'll see lists of items appearing in quite a few places:
<ul>
<li>The programme grids display items that are within their rooms/time lists, of course.</li>
<li>Going to a page for a person or a tag or a tech item will show all the programme items
associated with that particular thing.</li>
<li>The various checks generally list items.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
And, of course, you can ask for item lists directly:
<ol>
<li>Follow the "Items" link on the top banner</li>
<li>Choose different representations of the Items list, from "Items" link on the top banner.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
The entries in the list are all links; clicking on one will take you to the "Edit item"
page, which we'll come to in a bit.
</p>

<h3>Moving items</h3>
<p>
The easiest way to place an item
into a room at a given day and time is to use the <a href="{% url "help_grids" %}">programme grid</a>;
you can click on the "Fill slot" link for a given programme grid slot, and then select the
item to put there.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, use the "Edit item" page.
</p>

<h3>Editing items</h3>
<p>
When you click on an item's link, you're taken to a page which displays all the information
about that item. There's a link for editing the item's details, too.
</p>
<p>
This page also allows you to change the people, kit, tags and sequencing associated with the
item.
</p>
<h3>Adding people to an item</h3>
First thing to note is that you can't add a <em>new</em> person - one not already in the
database - to an item. You have to create the person first - see the <a href="{% url "help_people" %}">People</a>
page for that.
</p>
<p>
The association between an item and people has several attributes:
<ul>
<li>Role - is the person the moderator, a panellist, an interviewer, a gopher, etc. These roles
are configured from the "Manage" part of the Main page.</li>
<li>Status - is how sure you are that the person will be on the item. The database starts out
with "Proposed" (you've thought of that person), "Invited" (you've asked them), and
"Confirmed" (they've agreed).</li>
<li>Visible - Not everyone gets listed in the programme grid. The Masquerade might list the
MC, for example, but not the stage manager and gophers.</li>
<li>DistEmail - are they happy with the other people on the item getting their email address?</li>
<li>RecordingOkay - Are they happy with being recorded for this item?</li>
<li>Drink - Does this person receive a drink for participation?</li>
<li>Card - Do we print a name card for this person, to prop on the desk?</li>
<li>Optional - Should we consider it a problem if this person cannot attend this item, due to a scheduling clash?</li>
</ul>
<p>
When you click on "Add", then you can look at the item again, or add another person.
</p>

<h3>Removing people from an item</h3>
The page for a given item lists all the people associated with in, along with their
role, status and visibility for that item. Beside each person, there are a couple of
links:
<ul>
<li>Remove - allows you to remove that person from the item (they're not removed from the
database, or from any other items - only the link between the item and the person is
broken).</li>
<li>Edit - allows you to change change all the aspects of the item/person link. This is
basically like adding a new person, overwriting the old one, except that all the settings
default to what they are now. You can change the status, the role, the visibility - even
the person or the item.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Adding kit to an item</h3>
<p>
Items may need equipment, such as projectors, amplication, scoreboards, etc. This is
handled through <a href="{% url "help_kit" %}">Kit</a>.
</p>

<h3>Adding tags to an item</h3>
Adding <a href="{% url "help_tags" %}">tags</a> to an item (or, for that matter, to people) is
simple: from the item's page, click on the "Edit tags for [ITEM]" link, and you'll be
taken to a page that allows you to modify the list of tags that are associated with
this item. Removing tags is done in the same way.
</p>

<h3>Sequencing</h3>
<p>
Sequencing constraints indicate that programme item X must be immediately followed
by programme item Y, in the same room. This is used for things like setup and
tear-down. If you make these constraints, and then move one of the items, the other
item won't <em>automatically</em> be moved as well, but you will be able to identify that
the constraint no longer applies, by running one of the <a href="{% url "help_checks" %}">checks</a>.
