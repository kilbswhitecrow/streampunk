------
- Increase the coverage
- Sending email starts at p364.
- Test email. See p372 for local python server.
- See p300 for email testing.
- p842 for File Handling.
- p180 for 3.3.4 File Uploads

Testing
-------
XXX Have added the checkbox for badge_only, for Steve R, but now I realise that I also need
to provide a view of the whole person-list with that as a check-box, for ease of entering
a lot of such changes.

- Spotted the fixture-loading for individual tests, so using that.
- Can't really see a way to test the grids with Django, since Django doesn't generate them as
part of the ORM - it's all in the templates.
- Disturbed to notice that the clean() method for people:
	(a) is in the model Person, rather than in the ModelForm PersonForm.
	(b) doesn't return cleaned data (presumably because it's in the model).
- Added a constraint to ItemPerson to prevent the same person being added to the same item twice,
  and added a test for that.

Checks need short names for internal testing. Well, we don't *need* them, but it makes it
easier to find a Check in the db.

Comments from Simon's LJ
------------------------
Provisionally put people on an item, then let Streampunk say when that item could be run.

Comments from Michael Abbot
---------------------------
Save and restore (related to backups)
timing clash asap
short description and long description (latter is for panellists, to include email to panellists)
bug report: availabilty: superset of smaller avail couldn't be deleted. John Jarrold.
multiple versions of notes fields, wherein the committee decide which are pub/priv, including in email.
swap two items function. (Or rotate N items)
	- I should support permutations of ordering as well as rotations.
kit things - move-delays.
Bug: if person added multiple times, can't just remove one.
Suggestions for ways to fix clashes.
Check: concurrent items that have the same tag.
training course for progdb

Comments from Steve R
---------------------
notification that tech-related things have changed. How to have a change by Steve R
notify Lindsay that something has changed? Have people subscribe, to ask for email?

Next up
-------
- Look into tastypie for a REST API.
- XML dump, for ConText (Done; pending a review by Alex)
- Uh, default count on a kit thing should be 1, surely? Ditto a request?
- Revise the Slot structure *again*.
- Fix "fill slot" logic.
- Revisions

Kit, Generally
--------------
- Add a flag from prog team to tech team "please take note of this!" or
  "I don't understand this request!"
- object_list.html is not currently used, I believe, so should be okay to remove that. Maybe.
- We should have different Forms for editing rooms, based on the view of the person editing.

- Show Room issues
	- Kit Things don't show things in terms of bundles, just lists the Thing assignments.

(We remove people from an item, using delete_itemperson, which is AfterDeleteView(model=ItemPerson);
that's a normal DeleteView, but goes to the URL in 'after', if successful. Most of the work is done
by the implicit template of itemperson_confirm_delete.html. We can use that for deleting a single
Thing assignment, but that won't help for deleting all the things in a bundle.)

Grid Issues
-----------
- As well as having different schedules for different days, we should also be
able to have different schedules for different rooms. That would make the
options for moving an item interesting, though, because selecting a room would
change the possible time slots.
- Doesn't currently display items that start before the grid does.
- Doesn't list the grids in (day x time) table.
- Fill-slot doesn't list scheduled/unscheduled items. Should just
do that as two separate forms within the page, with two submits.
- I should present fill slot, swap item, etc. via a pop-up menu similar to the banner.

Table2 Issues
-------------
- Although I'm hiding the pagination outputs, the Tables are still being
created with a paginator, and so not all the tags are appearing in the
list. Need to turn this off somehow.

Other Things
------------
- I18N
               - Of  application
               - Of DB content
- use url in templates
	- Done, except for /admin/

- Grid:
	- Include kit in the grids.

- Make use of User Profile/Overall con preferences in grid display.
	And include the ability to edit the profile - seems we're
	missing that at present, so clicking on the username in
	the banner causes an exception.
- AJAX
- PDF generation
               - Door listings
               - Name cards
               - Drinks forms
- Static pages
	If I meant "use Django's static pages", then this is in place as part of move to WSGI
	If I meant "Generating static pages offline", then not done yet.
- Distribution mechanism (not just pushed up to github).
- Email attachments
- Item Moves. Add when we need that.
- Revisions
	Hide from edit field, default to latest.
	Need to model personel changes, too.
- User creation
	When we create a user, we should trigger the password-reset
	functionality, so that they get an email telling them about
	their password.

Missing Defaults:
- KitThings and KitRequests should default to a count of 1.

Missing Preferences:
- Display title on grid
Model corrections:
	- Add RoomRoutes:
		TimeWalking
		AllOnFlat
		inRadioRange

Bugs:
	- RoomCapacities should only be created on demand, when added to an item.

Things that need something better than the admin interface:
- The slot form: need to be able to enter a time, and have
  that converted to mins.

We should add %p1, %p2 kind of things to item blurb, so that people on the
programme can be named in the blurb.
