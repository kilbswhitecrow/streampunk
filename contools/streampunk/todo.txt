Drag and Drop
=============
- I have a table that renders and communicates with the server.
- It deals with CRSF, but does not yet require authentication.
- The Grid needs to include
	- CSS classes, for different renderings.
	- Some means of replacing "Fill Slot", to add new items.
	  (I favour a scrollable list of all items, from which things can be dragged.)

Comments from LonCon3
=====================
Eddie *also* said it was vital. Add a not-yet-existing person to an item.

Query about import mechanisms; I haven't really looked at that, beyond what loaddata does.
Need to check that it can add, rather than overwrite current content.

NineWorlds would like data ownership, e.g.:
	- There are many stream heads, and they should be able to edit their stream,
	but not those of others.
	- They shouldn't be able to see some aspects of the private data, e.g. email
	addresses. (?)

Comprehensions:
S = [ x+2 for x in range(10) ]
T = [ x for x in S if x % 2 == 0 ]

Checks
------
I should overhaul the entire Checks system, because I don't think there's
any benefit of having them in the database and imported and exec'd, which
is nasty, as opposed to being hardcoded into the system. It's not like
someone can add them via the admin.

PDF output
----------
I now have:
- Drinks Forms (all, item)
- Name Cards (all, item)
- Door Listings (all, room, day, room+day)
The day and room+day settings aren't used for Door Listings yet - there isn't
an obvious place to put a link.

I should also add a back-of-badge listing.

I don't have any useful way of regression-testing these, or making sure
I have coverage.

Badge-only
----------
Create a page of formsets to edit all the badge-only flags, and other booleans too.
Would be similar to the checks page.
Also make use of the personlist javascript code to make sure that we have toggle-all
functionality for this page, and the checks page.

PersonRole
----------
I have added the following:
- A "drink" flag, to indicate whether the person should get a drink.
- A "card" flag, to indicate whether the person gets a name card.
- An "optional" flag, so that if there's a clash, it's not so big a deal.
Now need to add some checks to verify that such Roles get discarded properly
in the clashes.

Item Rotation
-------------
Just checkboxes, and rotate? How to know the order?
Either formsets, or links with JavaScript to populate other fields in a form.

Bundle changes
--------------
I need to be able to delete bundles from items and rooms. The way to do this
properly is to be able to add bundles to items and rooms directly, and not
allow an item to be added individually if it's part of a bundle. This implies
quite a lot of changes, though:
	NOTE: This means KitItemAssignment no longer offers any benefit; we could do
	without the "through" now, I think.
	- NOT DONE YET: need to create an abstract class to contain all the methods, or there
- NOT NEEDED: change show_kitthing_detail()
- NOT NEEDED: change template for list_kitbundles()
- NEEDS EXTENDING: change the xml templates for kitthings, kitbundles, rooms and items
- change the demo_data

Comments from Simon's LJ
------------------------
Provisionally put people on an item, then let Streampunk say when that item could be run.

Comments from Michael Abbot
---------------------------
Save and restore (related to backups)
timing clash asap
short description and long description (latter is for panellists, to include email to panellists)
bug report: availabilty: superset of smaller avail couldn't be deleted. John Jarrold.
multiple versions of notes fields, wherein the committee decide which are pub/priv, including in email.
swap two items function. (Or rotate N items)
	- I should support permutations of ordering as well as rotations.
kit things - move-delays.
Bug: if person added multiple times, can't just remove one.
Suggestions for ways to fix clashes.
Check: concurrent items that have the same tag.

Comments from Steve R
---------------------
notification that tech-related things have changed. How to have a change by Steve R
notify Lindsay that something has changed? Have people subscribe, to ask for email?

Next up
-------
- Look into tastypie for a REST API.
- XML dump, for ConText (Done; pending a review by Alex)
- Uh, default count on a kit thing should be 1, surely? Ditto a request?
- Revise the Slot structure *again*.
- Fix "fill slot" logic.

Kit, Generally
--------------
- Add a flag from prog team to tech team "please take note of this!" or
  "I don't understand this request!"
- object_list.html is not currently used, I believe, so should be okay to remove that. Maybe.
- We should have different Forms for editing rooms, based on the view of the person editing.

Grid Issues
-----------
- Doesn't list the grids in (day x time) table.
- I should present fill slot, swap item, etc. via a pop-up menu similar to the banner.
- Grid should include kit and bundles.

Other Things
------------
- I18N
               - Of  application
               - Of DB content

- Make use of User Profile/Overall con preferences in grid display.
	And include the ability to edit the profile - seems we're
	missing that at present, so clicking on the username in
	the banner causes an exception.
- AJAX
- Static pages
	If I meant "use Django's static pages", then this is in place as part of move to WSGI
	If I meant "Generating static pages offline", then not done yet.
- Distribution mechanism (not just pushed up to github).
- User creation
	When we create a user, we should trigger the password-reset
	functionality, so that they get an email telling them about
	their password.

Missing Defaults:
- KitThings and KitRequests should default to a count of 1.

Missing Preferences:
- Display title on grid
Model corrections:
	- Add RoomRoutes:
		TimeWalking
		AllOnFlat
		inRadioRange

Bugs:
	- RoomCapacities should only be created on demand, when added to an item.

Things that need something better than the admin interface:
- The slot form: need to be able to enter a time, and have
  that converted to mins.

We should add %p1, %p2 kind of things to item blurb, so that people on the
programme can be named in the blurb.
