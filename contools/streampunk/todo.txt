Comprehensions:
S = [ x+2 for x in range(10) ]
T = [ x for x in S if x % 2 == 0 ]

Have modified availability to be a list of slots, rather than specific time periods,
but more needs to be done, here:
- checks need updating because they're not currently rendering results.
- Should write tests.

Testing
-------
XXX Have added the checkbox for badge_only, for Steve R, but now I realise that I also need
to provide a view of the whole person-list with that as a check-box, for ease of entering
a lot of such changes.

- Spotted the fixture-loading for individual tests, so using that.
- Can't really see a way to test the grids with Django, since Django doesn't generate them as
part of the ORM - it's all in the templates.
- Disturbed to notice that the clean() method for people:
	(a) is in the model Person, rather than in the ModelForm PersonForm.
	(b) doesn't return cleaned data (presumably because it's in the model).
- Added a constraint to ItemPerson to prevent the same person being added to the same item twice,
  and added a test for that.

Checks need short names for internal testing. Well, we don't *need* them, but it makes it
easier to find a Check in the db.

Provisionally put people on an item, then let Streampunk say when that item could be run.

notify Lindsay that something has changed? Have people subscribe, to ask for email?

Next up
-------
- Look into tastypie for a REST API. (Needs Django 1.5.1, though)
- XML dump, for ConText (Done; pending a review by Alex)
- Get regression tests in place. (in progress)
- Uh, default count on a kit thing should be 1, surely? Ditto a request?
- Update to django 1.5.1, then 6.
- Revise the Slot structure *again*.
- Fix "fill slot" logic.
- Revisions

Kit, Generally
--------------
- Add a flag from prog team to tech team "please take note of this!" or
  "I don't understand this request!"
- object_list.html is not currently used, I believe, so should be okay to remove that. Maybe.
- We should have different Forms for editing rooms, based on the view of the person editing.

- Show Room issues
	- Kit Things don't show things in terms of bundles, just lists the Thing assignments.

(We remove people from an item, using delete_itemperson, which is AfterDeleteView(model=ItemPerson);
that's a normal DeleteView, but goes to the URL in 'after', if successful. Most of the work is done
by the implicit template of itemperson_confirm_delete.html. We can use that for deleting a single
Thing assignment, but that won't help for deleting all the things in a bundle.)

Grid Issues
-----------
- As well as having different schedules for different days, we should also be
able to have different schedules for different rooms. That would make the
options for moving an item interesting, though, because selecting a room would
change the possible time slots.
- Doesn't currently display items that start before the grid does.
- Doesn't list the grids in (day x time) table.
- Fill-slot doesn't list scheduled/unscheduled items. Should just
do that as two separate forms within the page, with two submits.
- I should present fill slot, swap item, etc. via a pop-up menu similar to the banner.

Table2 Issues
-------------
- Although I'm hiding the pagination outputs, the Tables are still being
created with a paginator, and so not all the tags are appearing in the
list. Need to turn this off somehow.

Other Things
------------
- I18N
               - Of  application
               - Of DB content
- use url in templates
	- Done, except for /admin/

- Additional checks
		- Kit clashes
		- Item requests or room assingments where there are multiple things of the same kind

- Additional reports
	- Add a generic report for each item type, showing the counts of each.

- Grid:
	- Include kit in the grids.

- Make use of User Profile/Overall con preferences in grid display.
	And include the ability to edit the profile - seems we're
	missing that at present, so clicking on the username in
	the banner causes an exception.
- AJAX
- Regression testing (in progress)
- PDF generation
               - Door listings
               - Name cards
               - Drinks forms
- XML dump (pending review by Alex)
- Static pages
	If I meant "use Django's static pages", then this is in place as part of move to WSGI
	If I meant "Generating static pages offline", then not done yet.
- Distribution mechanism (not just pushed up to github).
- Email attachments
- Item Moves. Add when we need that.
- Revisions
	Hide from edit field, default to latest.
	Need to model personel changes, too.
- User creation
	When we create a user, we should trigger the password-reset
	functionality, so that they get an email telling them about
	their password.

Missing Defaults:
- Availabilities should default to: first con day, last con day, etc.
	- I should add them as per KitRequests, i.e. create and add in one, then can edit, and remove/delete.
	- I should add defaults that pull out the first and last slots in the con.
	- I should add some JavaScript buttons that set the fields to each day.
	- I need a Form that gives us date/time values in a more sane fashion, which we then map onto
	  actual DateTime fields for Availability.
- KitThings and KitRequests should default to a count of 1.

Missing Preferences:
- Display title on grid
Model corrections:
	- Add RoomRoutes:
		TimeWalking
		AllOnFlat
		inRadioRange

Bugs:
	- There's a problem with both Availability and Kit Requests, in that
	the same one can be assigned to multiple items; editing the object then
	changes it for every usage. We should have copy-and-save instead of edit,
	for these things, from the usual GUI
		- fix by marking them as "global"? Okay for a global instance to
		be shared. Editing a global instance bad.
	- For now, I've added a check to the Show_KitBundle page that removes the
	edit link if the bundle is in use.
	- For Kit Requests, I've removed the ability to create them *without* them
	being assigned to an item, and there isn't a way to assign them to an item
	if the kitrequest already exists, so no kit request should be used more
	than once.
	- Also applies to Room Capacities. Basically, anything that has a
	ManyToMany.

Things that need something better than the admin interface:
- The slot form: need to be able to enter a time, and have
  that converted to mins.

We should add %p1, %p2 kind of things to item blurb, so that people on the
programme can be named in the blurb.
