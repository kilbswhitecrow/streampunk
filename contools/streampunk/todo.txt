Testing
-------
- Django only loads initial_data.json by default, but I normally load a bunch of other fixtures
before doing any queries. That doesn't happen with the testing database, so I didn't notice that
just the default fixture doesn't support the find_default callable on Room. Fixed that, by moving
Nowhere and Everywhere to initial_data.json.
- Also removed the TZ from the baseline revision. Don't know why that was failing for the test
database, but wasn't for the normal one.
- There are a bunch of other tests that also fail, that have nothing to do
with me (I think), so I should investigate them, first.

Provisionally put people on an item, then let Streampunk say when that item could be run.

Kit, Generally
--------------
- Add a flag from prog team to tech team "please take note of this!" or
  "I don't understand this request!"
- object_list.html is not currently used, I believe, so should be okay to remove that. Maybe.
- We should have different Forms for editing rooms, based on the view of the person editing.

- Current links (all needs updating again):
	- Item:
		list_kitrequests.html
		list_kititemassignments.html
		Add Kit request to item	add_kitrequest_to_item
		Add Kit bundle to item	add_kitbundle_to_item
		add kit thing to item	add_kitthing_to_item
	- Room:
		list_kitroomassignments.html
		Add kit bundle to room	add_kitbundle_to_room
		Add kit thing to room	add_kitthing_to_room
	- Bundle
		list_kitthings.html
		list_kititemassignments.html
		list_kitroomassignments.html
		Remove Bundle		delete_kitbundle_from_item
		Remove Bundle		delete_kitbundle_from_room
	- Thing
		list_kitthings.html
		list_kititemassignments.html
		list_kitroomassignments.html
		Remove Thing		delete_kititemassignment (via DeleteView)
		Remove Thing		delete_kitroomassignment (via DeleteView)
		Remove Bundle		delete_kitbundle_from_item
		Remove Bundle		delete_kitbundle_from_room
	- Request
		Now lists items making the request.
	- Usage
		kit_usage.html
		list_kitroomassignments.html
		list_kititemassignments.html
		list_kitrequests.html
		Now includes removal links.

- Show Room issues
	- Kit Things don't show things in terms of bundles, just lists the Thing assignments.

(We remove people from an item, using delete_itemperson, which is AfterDeleteView(model=ItemPerson);
that's a normal DeleteView, but goes to the URL in 'after', if successful. Most of the work is done
by the implicit template of itemperson_confirm_delete.html. We can use that for deleting a single
Thing assignment, but that won't help for deleting all the things in a bundle.)

Grid Issues
-----------
- Doesn't currently display items that start before the grid does.
- Doesn't list the grids in (day x time) table.
- Fill-slot doesn't list scheduled/unscheduled items. Should just
do that as two separate forms within the page, with two submits.

Table2 Issues
-------------
- Although I'm hiding the pagination outputs, the Tables are still being
created with a paginator, and so not all the tags are appearing in the
list. Need to turn this off somehow.

Other Things
------------
- I18N
               - Of  application
               - Of DB content
- use url in templates
	- Done, except for /admin/

- Additional checks
		- Kit clashes
		- Item requests or room assingments where there are multiple things of the same kind

- Additional reports
	- Add a generic report for each item type, showing the counts of each.

- Grid:
	- Include kit in the grids.

- Make use of User Profile/Overall con preferences in grid display.
	And include the ability to edit the profile - seems we're
	missing that at present, so clicking on the username in
	the banner causes an exception.
- AJAX
- Regression testing
- PDF generation
               - Door listings
               - Name cards
               - Drinks forms
- XML dump
- Static pages
- Distribution mechanism (not just pushed up to github).
- Email attachments
- Item Moves. Add when we need that.
- Revisions
	Hide from edit field, default to latest.
	Need to model personel changes, too.
- User creation
	When we create a user, we should trigger the password-reset
	functionality, so that they get an email telling them about
	their password.

Missing Defaults:
- Availabilities should default to: first con day, last con day, etc.

Missing Preferences:
- Display title on grid
Model corrections:
	- Add RoomRoutes:
		TimeWalking
		AllOnFlat
		inRadioRange

Bugs:
	- There's a problem with both Availability and Kit Requests, in that
	the same one can be assigned to multiple items; editing the object then
	changes it for every usage. We should have copy-and-save instead of edit,
	for these things, from the usual GUI
		- fix by marking them as "global"? Okay for a global instance to
		be shared. Editing a global instance bad.
	- For now, I've added a check to the Show_KitBundle page that removes the
	edit link if the bundle is in use.
	- For Kit Requests, I've removed the ability to create them *without* them
	being assigned to an item, and there isn't a way to assign them to an item
	if the kitrequest already exists, so no kit request should be used more
	than once.
	- Also applies to Room Capacities. Basically, anything that has a
	ManyToMany.

Things that need something better than the admin interface:
- The slot form: need to be able to enter a time, and have
  that converted to mins.

We should add %p1, %p2 kind of things to item blurb, so that people on the
programme can be named in the blurb.
