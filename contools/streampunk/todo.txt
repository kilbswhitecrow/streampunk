- How to remove a kit bundle from a room? Or, more likely to edit the assignment?
- I18N
               - Of  application
               - Of DB content
- use url in templates
	- Done, except for /admin/

- Additional checks
		- Kit clashes
		- Item requests or room assingments where there are multiple things of the same kind

- Additional reports
	- Add a generic report for each item type, showing the counts of each.

- Grid:
	- Include kit in the grids.

- Make use of User Profile/Overall con preferences in grid display.
- Revisions
- AJAX
- Hide tech stuff, etc. behind javascript on item display
- Regression testing
- PDF generation
               - Door listings
               - Name cards
               - Drinks forms
- XML dump
- Static pages
- Distribution mechanism (not just pushed up to github).
- Item Moves. Add when we need that.
- Revisions
	Need to model personel changes, too.
- User creation
	When we create a user, we should trigger the password-reset
	functionality, so that they get an email telling them about
	their password.

Missing Defaults:
- Availabilities should default to: first con day, last con day, etc.
- Add bundle to room - room

Missing Preferences:
- Display title on grid
Model corrections:
	- Add RoomRoutes:
		TimeWalking
		AllOnFlat
		inRadioRange

Bugs:
	- There's a problem with both Availability and Kit Requests, in that
	the same one can be assigned to multiple items; editing the object then
	changes it for every usage. We should have copy-and-save instead of edit,
	for these things, from the usual GUI

Things that need something better than the admin interface:
- The slot form: need to be able to enter a time, and have
  that converted to mins.
