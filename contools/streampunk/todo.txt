- How to remove a kit bundle from a room? Or, more likely to edit the assignment?
	- Item:
		list_kitrequests.html
		list_kitthings.html
		Add Kit request to item	add_kitrequest_to_item
		Add Kit bundle to room	add_kitbundle_to_room
		add kit thing to item	add_kitthing_to_item
	- Room:
		list_kitthings.html
		Add kit bundle to room	add_kitbundle_to_room
		Add kit thing to room	add_kitthing_to_room
	- Bundle
		Doesn't have add-to for anything
	- Thing
		Doesn't have add-to for anything
	- Request
		Doesn't have add-to for anything

	* Have added KitRoomAssignment listing to room, with detail/edit views for KitRoomAssignments.
	(but should we allow editing of a kitRoomAssignment if it's part of a bundle? When assigning,
	we use AssignBundleToRoomForm or AssignThingToRoomForm, so we should stick with that, and then
	change the attributes of the whole bundle's assignment.
- I18N
               - Of  application
               - Of DB content
- use url in templates
	- Done, except for /admin/

- Additional checks
		- Kit clashes
		- Item requests or room assingments where there are multiple things of the same kind

- Additional reports
	- Add a generic report for each item type, showing the counts of each.

- Grid:
	- Include kit in the grids.

- Make use of User Profile/Overall con preferences in grid display.
- Revisions
- AJAX
- Regression testing
- PDF generation
               - Door listings
               - Name cards
               - Drinks forms
- XML dump
- Static pages
- Distribution mechanism (not just pushed up to github).
- Item Moves. Add when we need that.
- Revisions
	Need to model personel changes, too.
- User creation
	When we create a user, we should trigger the password-reset
	functionality, so that they get an email telling them about
	their password.

Missing Defaults:
- Availabilities should default to: first con day, last con day, etc.
- Add bundle to room - room

Missing Preferences:
- Display title on grid
Model corrections:
	- Add RoomRoutes:
		TimeWalking
		AllOnFlat
		inRadioRange

Bugs:
	- There's a problem with both Availability and Kit Requests, in that
	the same one can be assigned to multiple items; editing the object then
	changes it for every usage. We should have copy-and-save instead of edit,
	for these things, from the usual GUI
		- fix by marking them as "global"? Okay for a global instance to
		be shared. Editing a global instance bad.
	- Also applies to Room Capacities. Basically, anything that has a
	ManyToMany.

Things that need something better than the admin interface:
- The slot form: need to be able to enter a time, and have
  that converted to mins.
