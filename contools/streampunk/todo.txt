Kit, Generally
--------------

- No editing of assignment
- Show we just use the kit_usage lists for the item and room, filtered accordingly?

- Current links:
	- Item:
		list_kitrequests.html
		list_kitthings.html
		Add Kit request to item	add_kitrequest_to_item
		Add Kit bundle to item	add_kitbundle_to_item
		add kit thing to item	add_kitthing_to_item
	- Room:
		list_kitthings.html
		Add kit bundle to room	add_kitbundle_to_room
		Add kit thing to room	add_kitthing_to_room
	- Bundle
		Doesn't have add-to for anything
	- Thing
		Doesn't have add-to for anything
	- Request
		Doesn't have add-to for anything
	- Usage
		kit_usage.html
		list_kitroomassignments.html
		list_kititemassignments.html
		list_kitrequests.html
		Now includes removal links.

- Show Item issues:
	- Kit Requests and Kit Things should appear within the collapsible Tech section of the item.
	- It would make more sense if Show Item displayed which kit requests are fulfilled, and by
	  what - room or item assignment.
- Show Room issues
	- Kit Things are listed under the collapsible Tech section (good)
	- But don't show things in terms of bundles, just lists the Thing assignments.
- List Kit Requests
	- shows a kit request, but doesn't show *what* item requests it!
	- Doesn't show whether it's currently fulfilled.
	- Doesn't show how it's currently fulfilled, if it is.
- Show Kit Request
	- Shows the details of a request, but not the item that is requesting it.
	- Doesn't show whether it's currently fulfilled.
	- Doesn't how show it's currently fulfilled, if it is.
- Show Bundle Issues
	- We can edit a bundle, while the bundle's assigned to something. If we then
	  remove the bundle from a room/item, it'll either miss something out (leaving
	  a Thing attached), or will fail to find a Thing to remove.

(We remove people from an item, using delete_itemperson, which is AfterDeleteView(model=ItemPerson);
that's a normal DeleteView, but goes to the URL in 'after', if successful. Most of the work is done
by the implicit template of itemperson_confirm_delete.html. We can use that for deleting a single
Thing assignment, but that won't help for deleting all the things in a bundle.)

Other Things
------------
- I18N
               - Of  application
               - Of DB content
- use url in templates
	- Done, except for /admin/

- Additional checks
		- Kit clashes
		- Item requests or room assingments where there are multiple things of the same kind

- Additional reports
	- Add a generic report for each item type, showing the counts of each.

- Grid:
	- Include kit in the grids.

- Make use of User Profile/Overall con preferences in grid display.
- Revisions
- AJAX
- Regression testing
- PDF generation
               - Door listings
               - Name cards
               - Drinks forms
- XML dump
- Static pages
- Distribution mechanism (not just pushed up to github).
- Item Moves. Add when we need that.
- Revisions
	Need to model personel changes, too.
- User creation
	When we create a user, we should trigger the password-reset
	functionality, so that they get an email telling them about
	their password.

Missing Defaults:
- Availabilities should default to: first con day, last con day, etc.
- Add bundle to room - room

Missing Preferences:
- Display title on grid
Model corrections:
	- Add RoomRoutes:
		TimeWalking
		AllOnFlat
		inRadioRange

Bugs:
	- There's a problem with both Availability and Kit Requests, in that
	the same one can be assigned to multiple items; editing the object then
	changes it for every usage. We should have copy-and-save instead of edit,
	for these things, from the usual GUI
		- fix by marking them as "global"? Okay for a global instance to
		be shared. Editing a global instance bad.
	- For now, I've added a check to the Show_KitBundle page that removes the
	edit link if the bundle is in use.
	- Also applies to Room Capacities. Basically, anything that has a
	ManyToMany.

Things that need something better than the admin interface:
- The slot form: need to be able to enter a time, and have
  that converted to mins.
