==========
Streampunk is the first part of Contools, utilities for assisting in convention/conference administration and running.

Streampunk is a Django application for developing and managing the programme of the convention. It helps in:

* Managing which items happen in which rooms.

* Avoiding over-scheduling your programme participants.

* Communicating with your programme participants.

* Ensuring that your programme items have the kit they need, while keeping your Tech Crew happy.
