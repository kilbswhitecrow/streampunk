- How to remove a kit bundle from a room? Or, more likely to edit the assignment?
- Name change
- I18N
               - Of  application
               - Of DB content
- use url in templates
	- Done, except for /admin/

- Additional checks
		- Kit clashes
		- Unfulfilled kit requests

- Additional reports
	- Where each kit thing is used, when. The current lists don't show that.
	- Add a generic report for each item type, showing the counts of each.
	- Front page w/ con stats: items, people, drinks, etc.

- Revisions
- AJAX
- PDF generation
               - Door listings
               - Name cards
               - Drinks forms
- XML dump
- Static pages
- Copyrights, comments and licensing.
- Distribution
- Tech (see separate tech.txt file for that)
- Item Moves. Add when we need that.
- Con Data, in various forms.
- Revisions
	Need to model personel changes, too.
Model corrections:
	- Add RoomRoutes:
		TimeWalking
		AllOnFlat
		inRadioRange
	- ItemPerson.visible should be Boolean, not YesNo.

Things that need something better than the admin interface:
- The slot form: need to be able to enter a time, and have
  that converted to mins.
- Availabilities should default to: first con day, last con day, etc.
