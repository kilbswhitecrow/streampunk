Grid order is wrong for 10am/10pm grids. Missing in fact.
Move to virtualenv over the weekend. then we can get South in, and start on name change.
- How to remove a kit bundle from a room? Or, more likely to edit the assignment?
- Name change
- I18N
               - Of  application
               - Of DB content
- use url in templates
	- Done, except for /admin/

- Additional checks
		- Kit clashes
		- Item requests or room assingments where there are multiple things of the same kind

- Additional reports
	- Add a generic report for each item type, showing the counts of each.

- Grid:
	- Include kit in the grids.

- Make use of User Profile/Overall con preferences in grid display.
- Revisions
- AJAX
- Regression testing
- PDF generation
               - Door listings
               - Name cards
               - Drinks forms
- XML dump
- Static pages
- Copyrights, comments and licensing.
- Distribution
- Item Moves. Add when we need that.
- Revisions
	Need to model personel changes, too.
Model corrections:
	- Add RoomRoutes:
		TimeWalking
		AllOnFlat
		inRadioRange
	- Should we record a length to go with ItemRoomAssignment.toSlot, or just say that that's the first unused slot?
	- Profiles/ConInfo should have flags to include kit in grid.
		- As thing or as bundle.

Things that need something better than the admin interface:
- The slot form: need to be able to enter a time, and have
  that converted to mins.
- Availabilities should default to: first con day, last con day, etc.
