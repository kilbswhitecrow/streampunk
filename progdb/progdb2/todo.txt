- Add Kit Requests from Items
- Name change
- I18N
               - Of  application
               - Of DB content
- User profiles
- User permissions
- Use of permissions in templates and views
	Mostly done.
	Need to do login/logout redirects to appropriate pages.
- Email
	Mostly done. Need to modify the mail_item_with_personlist view,
	to have a Cancel button that deletes the personlist and returns
	to the item.
	Should also add a cancel button to mail_person that returns to
	the person.
	Should convert list_people.html so that it uses make_personlist.
	Should update the checks so that they can use it too.
	Should change show_item.html so that it has save_some/save_all
	options.
- Additional checks
               - people listings with email options.
		- Kit clashes
		- Unfulfilled kit requests

- Additional reports
	- Add a generic report for each item type, showing the counts of each.

- Revisions
- AJAX
- PDF generation
               - Door listings
               - Name cards
               - Drinks forms
- XML dump
- Static pages
- Copyrights, comments and licensing.
- Distribution
- Tech (see separate tech.txt file for that)
- Item Moves. Add when we need that.
- Con Data, in various forms.
- Revisions
	Need to model personel changes, too.
Model corrections:
	- Add RoomRoutes:
		TimeWalking
		AllOnFlat
		inRadioRange
	- ItemPerson.visible should be Boolean, not YesNo.

Things that need something better than the admin interface:
- The slot form: need to be able to enter a time, and have
  that converted to mins.
- Availabilities should default to: first con day, last con day, etc.
